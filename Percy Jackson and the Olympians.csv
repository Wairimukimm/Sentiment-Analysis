"This is not the same Percy that is in the books","I couldn't care less about the differences in how the characters LOOK in this show vs in the books. But I care immensely that Percy's character just doesn't... feel like Percy.  In the books, he's snarky and quick-witted, and he possesses this childish confidence where he believes he can take on the whole world. I don't feel like any of that comes across in the show. A couple examples: in the show he is simply not funny or witty, at all. I can't think of a single thing he said that made me laugh. His sarcastic commentary made me laugh so much as a kid and it is sorely missed.    in the show, he doesn't stand up to Gabe; instead, Sally does. This is a big flip of the power dynamic in the books, where Percy naively believes that he can solve his mother's problems for her, when the reality is that she's sacrificing everything for his sake. As a result Percy just seems like a bystander.    in the show he chooses to fight first with violence rather than using his words. For example, against Clarisse in the books a lot of their drama stems from him throwing clever insults at her but here he just fights (with fighting skills seemingly out of nowhere, by the way).   Perhaps I've read the books too many times, and at the end of the day, if the ""new Percy"" character worked just as well, I wouldn't criticize the changes. However, the problem is that I feel like the new Percy DOESN'T work, he's not a compelling protagonist at the moment and I don't find myself rooting for him. I will continue watching and I'm hoping this changes, but at the moment, I'm disappointed, especially since Riordan himself wrote the script.","4","22 December 2023"
"Ehhh","The personalities for characters Percy and Annabeth are so far off it hurts. I thought the big deal on this was that these actors were supposed to embody the characters so well, that looks didn't matter! Three episodes in and I'm not impressed. They made some weird changes to the story to shoehorn this snarky and combative new Percy in.  Percy starts off as whiney and clueless. No one is explaining things to him until he sounds like an idiot, and has stuck his foot in his mouth. He's rude, and not at all funny or caring about other people. Annabeth isn't supposed to be his best friend yet - but she is so hostile.  Whoever wrote the screenplays for these episodes needs to reread the source material.  The Aunty Em's storyline changes was a complete wasted disaster. I hope Disney would do better.","5","27 December 2023"
"Pleasantly Surprised","Initially, I had doubts about the show, especially concerning casting and worries about staying true to the original material after those cringe-worthy movies. But diving into the first two episodes surprised me-it brought back the Percy Jackson vibes, nailing visuals, characters, and the storyline. Despite visual tweaks, the characters' personalities felt spot-on. Percy is undeniably Percy, Annabeth is herself, and Grover has some extra depth. I'm really looking forward to the next episodes! The quality and attention to detail exceeded my expectations, promising an engaging series that captures the essence of the beloved books.","9","20 December 2023"
"If I had a Time Machine...","I was 11 when I first read Percy Jackson and the lighting thief. I was diagnosed with ADHD and dyslexia, and my mother gave me this book because some neighbor said it was good for kids like myself. To this day, one of the most influential books I've read.  I've been waiting for this series for a long time, and man it was worth the wait. 2 episodes in and you can already see the attention to detail they put into this show. The casting choices are so far great, the dialogue is excellent, and the kids they chose for Grover, Annabeth, and Percy have so far nailed their characters. It's obvious they are setting this up to do the entire series (which would be phenomenal) and the pacing is so far pretty good.  If I had a Time Machine, I'd take this show back to 11 year old me to just see the excitement on my face as my favorite character gets an amazing series like this. I'm excited to see where they take the show, and how they introduce new characters through the series like Thalia and Nico. I can only hope that this gets even a quarter of the hype as Harry Potter, but I'm just glad Percy Jackson's finally getting the screen adaptation he deserves.","8","21 December 2023"
"Meh","The movie is way better and so are the books. The dialogue is just dry and dull. The acting is just terrible. Casting is not great either and the show just moves so terribly slow. I was so disappointed in this series, it really is a shame to have such high hopes and now crash so hard to the ground. I don't know how the ratings are so high, this was just awful and hard to watch. Character portrayal, acting is subpar, dialogue, the monotonous talking in every scene can put you to sleep, especially Percy, ugh, just bad. Percy's voice and his bad acting just ruins the show for me. Stick to the books and the movie. Hard pass.","2","26 December 2023"
"Not perfect but leagues better than the film","Let me start off by saying that, as a fan of the books, this adaptation pays homage to the book series in just about every possible way.  It's entertaining, funny, and has a phenomenal soundtrack. The minotaur scene and the capture the flag scene in particular were well adapted to the screen.  Walker Scobell was probably the best possible choice to play Percy Jackson. With him as the lead role, it seems more genuine and we get a level of emotion that was distinctly absent from Logan Lerman's portrayal. Seeing such a young kid play Percy really made me realize that I never saw him as a 12-year-old in my mind. It makes me excited to see how Walker and his costars grow up with their roles.  As for the other actors, I think they were casted phenomenally. Diyonisus and Grover in particular are standouts to me. Each actor is great in their own role, but something about them seems off to me. It's almost like their acting is severely restrained, like they weren't allowed to do anything other than what was written for them. The actors themselves seem stiff, but they knew their characters without adding a lot of emotion.  The set pieces and cinematography are beautiful. The atmosphere of Camp Half Blood is wonderful and the implementation of Greek architecture for the cabins looks stunning.  I will update this review as more episodes release and my mind possibly changes.","8","20 December 2023"
"Disappointing","As an absolutely massive fan of the Percy Jackson book series I was ecstatic for the show to premiere. Like most book fans, I had found the movie series to be an extremely poor adaptation and unfaithful to the original series. I had very high hopes and expectations for the Disney+ reboot, especially with Rick Riordan involved in the show.  To my utter disappointment, the Percy Jackson show is an equal letdown as to the movie adaptations. The episodes are too short and extremely rushed, with no time for any type of character development or emotional response. Percy's mother passes, he doesn't even blink. He's a demigod, okay. He's at camp, he suddenly has best friends. I watched the first few episodes with someone who hasn't read the series and is unfamiliar with general Greek mythology, and they had no idea what was happening and were bored - as was I!  I'd recommend you skip this. Again, I was super exited as a book fan and all I can say is I'll go back to pretending there's no live adaptations of the classic and excellent series.","1","27 December 2023"
"Underwhelming","My headline pretty much says it. The pacing is too fast honestly (great for kids with short attention spans ig) and the lines seem pretty cliché and cheesy to be frank. The visual effects could also be a bit better. I know the movie wasn't everyone's favorite but I do think they had better visuals in it. The issue with the pacing is that it really isn't giving the audience enough time to create an emotional relationship with Percy that readers might already have. If anything this series is for them and no one else which doesn't make it good television. And I might be in the minority but there is nothing wrong with slowing down and letting your affections for the character grow. Since these are based on books they could've gone even MORE in depth than before but they actually are seeming to go faster through the intro stuff than they really should be. I think the show is overhyped and hope it gets better.","5","21 December 2023"
"Terrible acting and Casting Decision","What was Rick Riordan thinking? Did he really think this cast more accurately represented his books? This is a good example of why some authors should be left out of casting/film production. The acting is very bad and I mean very bad. These kids have little to no acting chops and their chemistry with each other is almost non existent. The quest almost presents no challenge, from the very beginning with Ms. Dobbs you didn't really feel like their lives were in danger or that they felt the stakes of their mission. Medusa was killed in a mere 10 seconds in the basement. I'd expect it to be a little more difficult for some 12 year olds. I hate to say it but I much prefer the movie adaptation over this garbage. Skip this if you don't want to waste your time.","1","28 December 2023"
"Love it","I really enjoyed the first 2 episode's. Tv is my escape from reality so having a show to grasp you and not let go is really hard to find anymore. I loved the books I loved the movies. I'm cool with them going away from the book alittle bit. I feel like sometimes that cld be a good thing. I enjoyed the fact they started the journey from the beginning. The acting isn't bad they are actually doing a great job on that end. The quality is great the scenes and the special effects are awesome. I'll say we're off to a great start. I think this is going to be a great show. Hopefully this show will get a real chance and be able to thrive.","8","20 December 2023"
"High hopes unfulfilled","Heavily expository dialog, slow pacing, odd framing of scenes--why so many shots from behind when characters are speaking?--and clumsy fight choreography are just some of the factors that prevented me from enjoying the first two episodes of a show I was eagerly anticipating. I can't believe I'm saying this, but I prefer the admittedly flawed film. Even the SFX in the film seemed better, and to check my memory, I rewatched the film after struggling to stay awake during the Disney+ series, and yes, those effects from 2010 survive the comparison. The early encounter with the minotaur, for example, feels more kinetic and dangerous in the film, while the TV version fails to convince that the adolescent Percy could in any way survive the encounter.","5","22 December 2023"
"The movie adaptation was better than this & thats saying a lot","I was really looking forward to this show. I read the books as a kid and really enjoyed them and of course like many others, when the movies came out I was disappointed with how they failed to follow the source material and that was the main downfall of the movie adaptation & with this show we were supposed to get a loyal adaptation that goes more in depth because its a TV show & yet its making the exact same mistakes as the movies while somehow feeling MORE rushed than the movie adaptation, which doesn't make sense at all because it's a TV show, they should be able to go more in depth, right?  The breakneck pace of the show felt like they were speed-running through the plot, leaving no time to savor the story's essence. It's like they threw the script together in a rush, resulting in cringeworthy dialogue and performances that made it impossible to take things seriously. If I was a viewer who hadn't read the books, I wouldn't even be able to process what was happening, they do a poor job of explaining the story and the significance of a lot of important things in the plot.  Connecting with Percy, our main guy, was a struggle. He felt as bland as unseasoned chicken. There was this void where his personality should've been-nowhere near as charismatic or relatable as he was in the books. It's tough to root for a hero who doesn't make you feel anything.  The whole cast in general, unfortunately, didn't do much to save the day. I was hoping for engaging, funny characters that I could latch onto, but it was like they missed the memo on charm and relatability all the characters have in the books. Clarisse was the lone standout who had a shred of resemblance to her book self, but the rest fell flat. It's disappointing when a show fails to capture the spark that made the source material so beloved. This TV show was supposed to be a better adaptation of the books, but, so far, it's been a worse adaptation than the movies.","1","23 December 2023"
"After 2 Episodes it's...alright","This is my 2 episode review, so take it with a healthy grain of salt. As someone who grew up reading the books, this show has a special place in my heart by default. When it was announced, I was extremely excited. I'm glad to say that it, in some ways, lives up to my expectations. I loved seeing book-accurate Camp Half-Blood and the characters actually act like themselves (unlike in another movie). In other ways, it unfortunately falters, resulting in a less than stellar viewing experience.  The show is very faithful to the books, almost to a fault. The editing is quite choppy, with an uncomfortably long black screen repeatedly indicating a scene shift. This makes the story feel disjointed, to the point that I sometimes felt like I was watching a stage play. Characters would run offscreen when the scene changes and anything not on screen is treated like it doesn't exist by the actors. Of course, this is expected given the younger, more inexperienced cast, though I felt a distinct lack of soul nonetheless. The music is also quite bland, adding very little to the scenes. There are thankfully a few standout performances so far. The first is by Virginia Kull as Sally Jackson, who elevates a lot of the emotional beats of the first episode. Second, Aryan Simhadri makes a very convincing Grover, demonstrating a clear understanding of the nerdier, nervous Grover that we haven't seen yet in live action. The rest of the cast remains unfortunately wooden, which I fear is a result of the poor writing and direction. Walker Scobell has his moments as Percy, but most of the time looks like he doesn't know why he's on set. His delivery is passable, comparable to Daniel Radcliffe's in the first Harry Potter movie. I expect, if the series continues, he'll grow into his role as the titular character. Some scenes from the book that serve to characterize our heroes, such as Luke's duel with Percy or Annabeth giving the tour, are cut, resulting in a less emotionally engaging viewing. CGI and green screen are generously used for the settings and monsters, with varying quality outcomes. The Minotaur looked very good, but the Big House looks like an airbrushed CGI monstrosity. A lot of the sets felt like aircraft hangars, with unconvincing lighting and design. The direction and cinematography made me feel more like I'm watching everything happen from a few feet away than like I'm actually in the story. There's also a distinct lack of scene setting shots. It's just plain ugly to look at too many times for me not to say anything.  In short, I'm excited to see a more faithful adaptation of one of my favorite childhood book series, though I feel like a lot of the technical and directional creative choices are really taking away from that. I remain hopeful that the show will prove itself with some of the more poignant emotional beats later on, but so far it's not great. I'm giving it an optimistic 7/10 now, mostly because I really love the original series, but we'll see what happens next. I hope the next episodes shatter my expectations.","7","20 December 2023"
"Disappointed","Disappointed.  That's the right word to describe how I'm feeling after watching the first few episodes. I'm a fan of the books. When I was a kid I was more obsessed with Percy Jackson than Harry Potter. I even got to wear an orange shirt and go to ""half-blood"" meetings in the squares.  1- It sounds silly, but if you read the books and were a fan, you understand why most fans didn't really like the differences in physiognomy of the main characters (mainly Percy and Annabeth). And ignoring the differences in physiognomy, I also didn't like the performance of the actors who play most of the main characters (only Grover saves).  2- It's very childish. I understand that in the first book, Percy is 12 years old, but some scenes that were supposed to convey fear or apprehension were so ridiculous that instead of being apprehensive, I laughed, because they were so ridiculous (for example the scene with the minotaur). Percy Jackson is children's literature, but it is not a cartoon.  3- I was too anxious, and I was disappointed. Before, I hoped the series would last until Heroes of Olympus, but today I don't even know if I'll be able to finish watching the first season...  Note: If you're looking for something to watch with your kids, or if you're under 15, you'll probably like it. Otherwise, probably won't.","1","21 December 2023"
"FAITHFUL TO THE BOOKS, FUNNY AND FAST PACED","This is what happens when you involve the creator of the books in making of a show. The show is updated, funny, fast paced and emotional. I love what they did with Gabe, to highlight Sally's character. The minotaur scene is exceptional, I love the locations and the dialogues. Walker is so funny and on point as Percy. His chemistry with his costars are on the roof. You will really root for hin as the lead. I love how they're also fleshing out Grover and his dynamics with Percy. I want to say, Percy and Annabeth's chemistry is so good. Leah Jeffries nails her every line delivery. The music, Bear Mcreary is a genius, I love the main theme and the score. Can't wait for the next episodes.","10","20 December 2023"
"Sadly disappointing","I watched just the first episode for now (but read all the books), and there are several glaring issues: 1) horrible action scenes - the fight with Harpy Dodds in the beginning is over in a second, without reading the book it's hard to understand how she was defeated at all (she just went poof in the show lol)  Also the Minotaur fight was just awful - first of all Percy somehow sees from the front seat in the dark and pouring rain that it's the Minotaur (who is still pretty far away) who's chasing them, and even the fact that it's in underpants (felt really out of pocket in the scene they made  The part after the car crashed was even worse - no sense of danger or urgency, they spent forever just standing there speaking and then there was that stupid standoff where Percy's mom ""died"" very anticlimacticly (and storywise her ""sacrifice"" did nothing with how Percy was just standing there, again)  Then the Percy vs Minotaur fight was meh as well, it reminded me of Harry vs Troll fight in first Harry potter movie (this is not a compliment), and somehow Percy broke off the horn with his bare hands?!? (reminder that this kid is 12)  2) terrible pacing in general - everything felt very boring and janky at the same time  3) Percy is not very similar to book Percy in personality - book Percy is a snarky and fun protagonist to follow while this Percy is on the bland side (don't think this is the actors fault, but more like how filmmakers approached adapting the source material)  I really hope they'll improve later because at least the first episode was a big heap of disappointment.","3","25 December 2023"
"Honestly just feels a bit sloppy","I read the books a while back, but long enough to not remember much so I'm watching the show fresh. So far the story is decent I would say. No extreme flaws in my opinion right now. My biggest issue is just the actual quality of the show. First off, the acting just hurts. Percy couldn't be paid to show emotion, I swear. Grover is pretty decent in my opinion. Jason Mantzoukas is just himself as usual, if not more tame. It's not helped by the cheesy writing. The bully girl feels like a stupid satire. The way she has her goons and is just annoying for no reason. Like she will be like, ""I don't want to kill you,"" and then proceed to attack him with a spear with hits that if connected, would have literally impaled him. Like is she just mad he killed the monster, why is she trying to murder him. Also why wouldn't Mr. D and Centaur guy tell Percy his mother was in the underworld. Like aren't they trying to get him to go down there anyway, why not give him the most compelling reason he could ever have. VFX aren't terrible in my opinion. Most centaur scenes look pretty solid. The editing is odd though. Throughout both episodes, scenes will awkwardly fade to black before jump cutting back in, hard to describe. It just feels a bit sloppy.","5","21 December 2023"
"It is good but","This is a great show. A very typical fantasy adventures and it has all the story lines and directions as you would expected. Nothing extraordinary or clever twists (not yet as only 2 episodes released so far). And it doesn't need to be. It doesn't try hard to be different.  This is simply a fun family entertainment and I like it.  However, the main lead acting is not convincing. His expression is almost the same in every scene and barely convey much emotion according to the events in front of him. Good looking does not make you a great actor. He needs to improve his acting for thr next season. Great kid actor/actress he can check out are. Summer Fontana (Hope in The Original) and Colton Osorio (young Luffy in One Piece).  Other than the lead actor, everything else is good so far.","7","27 December 2023"
"This is a great show but.....","I just watched the first two episodes of Percy Jackson and The Olympians. It was great and stay more true to the original source than the movies. The cast was great and CGI was better. Story pace well done, not too quick not to slow. But..... for me personally something still missing.  Bring me back Alexandra Daddario and Pierce Brosnan! I don't care what role they would play in this series but really, they were really iconic as Annabeth and Chiron. Actually I miss Logan Lerman too but since he cannot reprise his role as Percy, so I think I just might let it go this time. But Alexandra and Pierce?! No way man  Good series 8/10.","8","21 December 2023"
"A lot of nitpicks but overall Wish the quality was better","Just off of the first 2 episodes alone, I wish the overall quality was better. I have read the books and I love them and I like that thier keeping more to the sourse material unlike the movies which didnt. The movies weren't that great. But for me the overall quality in the movie that's over 11 years old looks much better than the show. Thiers a lot of weird fade to black scenes that was just random, I wasnt a fan of that. The Minotaur didn't feel threatening at all expessially with Sally playing Luchador with it, the movie version just seemed a lot more threatening. And thier 2-3 minute conversation they had outside of camp basically just waiting for the minotaur to catch up. Instead of actuall metal armour to protect themselves during capture the flag they just wear leather armour to protect themselves from real swords and magic weapons. And Jason Mantzoukas seemed to be the best adult actor out of the entire cast so far. I'm not gonna go on about the child actors since thier still new to acting.","6","20 December 2023"
"I really liked it.","First I would like to say that I haven't read the books so this review is based solely on the show. (I did get spoiled on a couple things in a later book though)  This show is really charming and fun. The characters are well written, the story is intriguing and it hooked me straight away.  I love the tone and feeling of the show. It feels really great and it's very easy to just sit down and watch.  I also really love the storyline with Percy being a halfblood. I've never been into Greek mythology but this show has surprised me with how much I like it.  The pacing is perfect for me and I love seeing them do camp stuff.  I especially love the main trio of the show. I haven't seen much of them all together but I can already tell it's going to be great.  I'm so excited for the rest of the season and I hope it gets renewed soon.","10","20 December 2023"
"I'm Actually Impressed","Firstly, this show rekindled the nostalgic fantasy fiction vibe from my childhood, and even at 20, I appreciate its mature approach without losing its charm. Walker Scobell shines as Percy, capturing the youthful yet troubled, loyal facets of the character impeccably. The portrayal of side characters, especially Grover, Annabeth, and Luke, stood out for me, offering a nuanced and authentic touch. The characters feel refreshingly new while staying true to their book counterparts. A standout moment, notably in episode two during the capture the flag scene, where Percy is claimed as Poseidon's son, became my favorite.","10","21 December 2023"
"I gave it a chance...","Honestly? It's pretty bad. After seeing the casting I was worried, and rightfully so. It's one thing to cast a black girl in the role of Annabeth but to have a blond Percy is just a kick in the pants. But nevertheless I gave it a chance. My one true hope was that the the actor for Percy would pull through considering how great he was in that movie with Ryan Reynolds but not even he was up to par. But even with the bad acting you can hope the series is accurate with the books right? Wrong. The portrayal of camp half blood is actually not half bad but take ""Smelly Gabe"" for instance... my guy is not the hated character I grew up with. He's just kinda mid. He's not even as abusive as he was in the books. Anyways let me give a run down of the inaccurate casting: Percey has Blond hair, Annabeth is black, Grover is East Indian, Luke is Asian, Chiron is black, Clairese is black. Like what the heck??? Oh and side note but Luke pronounces Thalia's name wrong.","2","27 December 2023"
"Not the show I wanted","The series so far had made Sally Jackson a jerk, Grover a traitor, and Percy a wuss. All he cares about is being accepted by his dad. Missing big parts of the book. So far, the movie intro was better than both episodes.  Percy is the best character, for sure. He's a great Percy Jackson. He's just been put in bad situations. Love his sass.  Grover is alright. He does things though that are nothing like book Grover at all.  Annabeth...I'm not sure about yet. A lot of her parts were given to Luke.  Love Luke. Perfect selection of him. No complaints at all.  CGI switches from good to terrible depending on the situation. Soundtrack is very good though and the fight scenes have been cool.","2","20 December 2023"
"Literal Perfection","I don't know how Rick managed to do it but he somehow captured exactly how I always imagined the books and put it on the screen! Everything from the cast to the cinematography to the music to the set design was better than I ever could have imagined. The young cast is incredible (Walker is literally Percy come to life) and the supporting characters easily steal the show in their moments. The additions to the story are also very well done and work to flesh out the world of the books. I honestly couldn't ask for a better adaption of my favourite childhood books. Percy Jackson you will always be famous. 10/10 no notes.","10","20 December 2023"
"Great Potential","As a long time fan of the books and hater of the OG films I came into this with a lot of excitement and anxiety.  Let me say this straight up. If you're a fan of the books, don't be afraid of this show. It's got the solid makings of what we always wanted. Starting with its main three cast members and a strong supporting cast. You can tell the intention from the makers is there too. The world feels tangible and like they're trying to bring what's on the page to the screen in a way that honors Rick's writing and if something's a little different that's ok too, because Uncle Rick is the one who adapted it anyways.  Just like with any show/series there will be growing pains and figuring out what works and what doesn't. So far, after the first two episodes (as that's all that's available) my biggest complaints are the pacing, I wish we could rest in the world a little more at times, editing, there are jump cuts and pacing issues, and directing choices, the actors are not being used to their full potential at moments but get away with raw talent.  All of these things can be easily remedied as the series progresses and matures. All we have to do is put our support behind it.","7","20 December 2023"
"Why not stick to the books?","I was really looking forward to the series after watching the movies and then reading the books. The first movie was ""okay"" for me. The second one was a disaster. About 2-3 years ago, I started reading the books because I really like stories about mythology.  I don't understand why a series is created if so much from the books is still ignored. In my opinion, Annabeth is completely misrepresented in terms of character. What's up with the weak portrayal of Medusa? I get it's Disney, but did Medusa really need to wear the cap?! Why doesn't Percy have a backpack and carries that silly shoebox around? And why is the series so rushed?  We still didn't have time to bond with the characters and he is already on his mission.  Don't they all learn from GOT that a rushed season won't be enjoyed by fans?","3","28 December 2023"
"EVERYTHING I HOPED FOR!","I read the Percy Jackson series as a kid, and loved it. It's always meant a lot to me, so naturally I've waited for it's adaption to TV. I saw the movie version with Logan Lerman and felt a lot things were missing. I was content with Lerman as Percy, but the rest of the cast felt off to me, in my opinion. The age difference also annoyed me, because it felt important that the story begins when they are actual kids and so on. So I am sooo thrilled about the TV show. I think Walker Scobell does and excellent job as well as the rest of the cast. It's visually beautiful and everything I imagined while reading. So I couldn't be happier. I definitely recommend watching it!","10","20 December 2023"
"Lower than expectations","My expectations for this new series weren't that high considering what I've seen from the trailers. But the show still didn't meet my low expectations.  Now the show isn't terrible. There are many small things in here that fans and non-fans of the book series can appreciate. But overall, the series is lackluster.  One of the biggest problems is the characters. Grover is nothing like how he is in the books. There's a scene in the book where Percy gets in trouble and Ms Dodds, the fury, tries to take him away to punish him but Grover tries to take the blame for Percy. It shows that Grover is both a loyal friend and a great protector. In the show, one of the first things he does is betray Percy by getting him kicked out of school. There was no reason for this betrayal. Rick Riordan didn't include this in his book because it creates unnecessary conflict which causes a rift between Grover and Percy's friendship.  They ruined Gabe's character. I don't praise the movies often, but Gabe Ugliano was one the best parts of the first movie. He was a terrible guy who you loved to hate. In the show, he's quite the pushover and it doesn't feel like Sally is struggling to raise Percy. She has Gabe wrapped around her finger, which makes her feel weaker here, not strong.  When we get to Annabeth, she's reduced to nothing more than a stalker. That's her entire relationship with Percy while they're at camp: she stalks him. Oh and also she says he drools in his sleep because that was a line from the book. Except whereas in the book it's played for laughs. Here it's unsolicited and makes no sense in context.  There's actually many times when a character will just exposit information when it's uncalled for. Like Grover saying how he's 24 when nobody asked or how he brings up his Uncle Ferdinand. Or how Dionysus calls Percy, Peter Johnson, out of the blue because that's what's in the books. Dionysus also felt really off. He's played as a petulant scammer instead of a unruly authoritarian with godlike power.  I'll probably watch the next episode, but I won't be expecting much.","4","27 December 2023"
"All I can say is WOW","I read this book in grade 5, the year after it was released. I read it agin in the anticipation of the series and WOW. It is the best book to screen adaptation I have ever seen in my life. I cannot believe how wonderful it is. I absolutely sobbed. I work in the film industry and I have never seen a better screen to film adaptation in my life. I read the book again in antics and I can not believe how close this show is. The older movies were horrible, I think all of us OG fans can agree on that. This completely blows the older films out of the water. I can not believe how phenomenal this show is.","10","20 December 2023"
"The Adaptation We Have Waited Over A Decade For","I originally had my doubts on whether this show would be a faithful adaptation or yet another disappointment, but with Rick being heavily involved in creating the show, I had high hopes. I never had any reservations about the cast though. For me it isnt about the color of an actors skin, their religion, or anything else that makes everyone so unique, its all about how they can portay the characters and make it their own, and for everyone involved they did exactly that. Leah is Annabeth Chase, the way she speaks and acts and carries herself both in the show and in real life. She is a true a daughter of Athena. Aryan Is Grover Underwood. You can really feel all the emotions and the way he cares deeply not just for Percy, but for his mom and everyone at camp, he truly is amazing. And finally Walker is Percy Jackson. He brings Percys humor and snark to reality. If you dislike the show because the characters arent what you envisioned them as in your minds, then honestly I dont want to hear from you. Race or hair color, or any other attribute should not make or break a character. I knew the second the first episode started that this was gonna be a faithful adaptation of the books than the two Peter Johnson movies ever were. We got flashbacks of baby Percy, we got Sally Jackson and Smelly Gabe playing an expanded role than they ever did in the movies, and we even got Nancy Bobofit and Clarisse. Two characters that were noticeably absent in the first movie. All of the acting and visual effects and easter eggs (the one that really stood out to me was Percy and Grover with the mythomagic cards). I cant wait to see the rest of the book come to life in this amazing adaptation from Disney and look forward to seeing more easter eggs and scenes not in the book and the eventual announcement of more seasons in the future.","10","20 December 2023"
"Stunningly well made","Reviving my faith in humanities ability to make a decent fantasy series!  Almost every character feels accurate to the book, I only have a problem with Dionysus because the actor always plays a dumb comic relief, and some of the acting can be stiff which is forgivable since the cast is mostly very young.  After the abysmal movie adaptation I'd lost hope this series would ever receive a faithful adaptation, thankfully I've been proven wrong. I can barely remember the books but watching this version is unlocking key memories from my teenage years, and honestly even without the nostalgia this show is phenomenal on a level I don't think any other teen fantasy drama tv show has achieved.","9","20 December 2023"
"THAT'S HOW YOU DO ADAPTATIONS!","Doesn't matter you have read the books or not, you're gonna love the show. Its a strong recommendation for people like me who love this children's fantasy action/adventure genre.  First of all, props to Rick Riordan for starting the 1st episode with the monologue as it was in the books. I think they have fixed pretty much everything wrong with the movies. Walker Scobell might not have Percy's hair but he matches his energy. Annabeth is different from the books only on the basis of looks not personality.  Overall, the show has great quality and magnificent cinematography, especially that Minotaur scene was visual masterpiece. If the show continues to be this good, believe me it is going to be a big thing in the future like the Harry Potter series.","8","20 December 2023"
"Very meh","When compared to the movies the show is a lot more accurate, but many noticeable details are off. The characters have no emotion, the casting is terrible, and the acting is questionable at best. While I understand wanting the characters to be as age accurate as possible, an extra year or two to their age would have done wonder as far as acting skills go. They obviously don't care about many other details that are arguably less minor than age. While parts are funny, other jokes just don't land at all. There are also parts unnecessarily added compared to the book. Overall it is a very meh show that did not meet my expectations.","2","21 December 2023"
"Disappointed But Hopeful","I unfortunately was disappointed and disheartened by both the first two episodes and the majority of the reviews claiming this show to be ""perfect"" and ""amazing."" As an avid fan of the books myself and having grown up with them over the past 11 years, I was shocked at how many other self proclaimed book lovers called this the adaptation we finally deserved. I think we could have done better.  Pros: The cinematography was stunning. It drew me into the world for sure, especially in the first 5 minutes before things went sideways.  Walker Scobell makes a great Percy in terms of energy and delivery. His acting is incredibly grounded (especially in comparison to others). As for other characters, acting was over the top either as a directing choice or the actors choice, making it to less believable and more kiddie. Bringing us to...  Good for younger kids. I'll get more into this point later too, but if you're concerned if you're 4th grader can watch this, I definitely think it's fine for them.  Cons The Script: I love Rick Riordan. I love his books. But I'm not sure he and the writers room knew how to translate that writing style into a shorter form script for television. To me, it felt like someone's first screenplay who's used to writing longer form, so I'm wondering if that's exactly what happened.  The writing felt incredibly base. There was no subtext at all. Characters said exactly what they meant. Pacing was all over the place. You can tell in the first episode all that's happening is rushing to get to Camp Half-Blood. Huge inciting incidents in the book are over in about 10-30 seconds in the show, while added unnecessary content is drawn out for some reason.  Brief Spolier: For example, why did we spend time on Percy talking to a maintenance man outside the hallway of his apartment, and not on the fight with Mrs. Dodds which wasn't even a fight?  The exposition dump in episode one is painful. Obviously you need to explain how this world works to new viewers, but I don't understand why we had to explain so much so soon and so fast. I would've preferred we figured it out along the way. Build some mystery and intrigue.  Character Arcs and Personas Heavily Altered: Sally Jackson, Grover, and Gabe had some pretty out of character moments in comparison to their book counterparts.  Spoiler: Instead of Percy overhearing Grover talk to Mr. Brunner privately about Percy, Grover lies to the principal and gets him expelled in front of his face. I guess they're trying to establish a sense of betrayal. But I don't know why that was done by villainizing Grover.  Spoiler: Gabe is no threat whatsoever. He's a bum who's just kind of there as opposed to the abuser he is in the books. Which brings me to...  Spoiler: Sally. Seems emotionally unstable and eccentric. Sits out in the pouring rain listening to a sad Olivia Rodrigo song and I don't know why. She's the one thing in Percy's life that is stable and happy. I guess they wanted to give her ""more dimension"" but it came across as erratic to me. She also stands up to Gabe immediately as opposed to taking his awfulness quietly for Percy's sake. In the books she stands up to him but not until the very end because she goes on a whole character arc. Here she does it immediately which automatically takes out any stakes of Gabe being dangerous.  Little Screen Time For Main Characters: Where were Annabeth and Grover (our main two characters next to Percy) like all of episode two?  Confusing target audience: As I said before, this show would be great for kids. But that's also my con. Because it was not advertised to be as kiddie as it was. Obviously this is all based on a YA book series, so yes kids read it and that's the main audience. I was 12 during my first read through. What I love about the books though is that I've continued to re-read them in my adult years and find them just as good and relatable. It's something an adult can read to a kid that they'd both enjoy.  Then the show rolls around and it's advertised like it will be the next Harry Potter or Star Wars adaptation. For kids but also adults too. I, however, felt like this was only the slightest step above Disney channel. 4th grade me would've loved. Adult me who went to film school and learned how to write, direct, produce, and act does not.  Overall, this show feels more like supplementary material to the original story as opposed to an adaptation. It's the same core story but with different ways of getting there that we haven't seen before. Now that I know this and that I'm definitely not the target audience I'm still wary but hopeful to see how the rest of it turns out. I can go in with that mindset as opposed to the epic adaptation I was expecting it to be. It (hopefully) can only continue to improve over time as they find their footing.","4","22 December 2023"
"Overrated and Underperforming","30 minutes into the first episode and it's actually making me cringe. The pacing is off and the dialogue is horrible, but some how the acting manages to be so so so much worse. Are they reading off a teleprompter??? The monotoned one emotion acting is not only cringeworthy but an affront to the comparatively minimal mistakes made in the first attempt at this series.  Filled with a cast of unremarkable actors, the acting and directing makes me think of the D-list movies that would run on the SciFi channels after 10pm on weeknights (except those actually had suspense).  This show should be renamed ""Percy Jackson and the Maximum Dose of Valium"".","1","22 December 2023"
"A non-book reader's impressions of ep 1 & 2","I think there was so much focus in getting the rising action started (Percy going on the quest) that they forgot to flesh out the characters and ground the world building.  See lengthy explanation below.  1) Characters - Percy & Grover:  I'm not convinced that Percy and Grover are best friends and genuinely have love for one another. I guess maybe Grover's age would make the relationship seem predatory 💀 but I think Grover's ""betrayals"" (when he got Percy kicked out of school and when he left Sally with the minotaur) would have a better dramatic impact if it was successfully established beforehand that Grover and Percy have a strong bond. I think the episodes really could have used more angst and should have focused more on showing the rift and broken trust in their friendship. It also would've made the end of episode 2 such a good payoff for their arc because it presents as an opportunity for Grover to regain Percy's trust and restore their friendship.  2) Character: Percy's mental health and bullies  I LOVE that scene when Percy confides in his mom at the cabin and tells her that he's scared that something is wrong with his brain. It was very relatable and in a dark humor kind of way made me laugh when his mom tells him that he's a demi-god and then Percy gets taken aback at his mom sounding crazier than him 😭 I think it's really nice that his struggle as a demi-god who perceives the world differently can be related to neurodivergent kids' struggles in real life.  I also like that scene where Percy tries to make sense of Nancy's bullying and has empathy for her possibly unfortunate home life. It shows that Percy has compassion to the people who hurt him, but he is also courageous enough to defend himself when he's had enough. I wish, however, that Nancy was the only bully in the school. I couldn't really make sense of everyone else bullying Percy, much less Grover. Instead of the physical bullying and insulting remarks, I think it would've been a more fitting portrayal if the other kids were more avoidant of Percy and would whisper hurtful rumors or silently judge him with their eyes. I think this better complements Percy's feeling of isolation and low self-esteem.  3) Dialogue - Percy's humor, Luke & Chiron as talking heads  I really enjoyed Walker Scobell's performace in the Adam Project and was hoping to see a bit of that sass in the series, but I felt many of his character's jokes were unsuccessful. To be honest, the thing that made me like Percy's character the most was the non-dialogue scene in which Percy is left by Annabeth alone in the woods, and we see him play with a leaf, a lizard, and whistle a melody while peeing on a log. I think Scobell's talent shined in this scene because he probably had more freedom to improvise in it. I'm assuming his other performances in the series seem so stiff and rigid because of poor direction and another bad case of making the actor say each line word for word.  Another example that supports my assumption is the excessive use of ""narration""--I am putting them in quotes because ""explainer"" is a more accurate term. We see this a bit with Mr. Brunner/Chiron's character, but most especially with Charles Bushnell's performance as Luke, who is supposed to look like a mentor figure for Percy but functioned more as a lazy way of explaining the world building of the story to the audience. This is a bit understandable since Rick Riordan, the book's author, played a big role as the series pilot's co-writer. Considering his background as an author, it then comes as no surprise that he made use of so much ""explainers,"" and struggled to make his expertise in the written word translate well into the visual medium.  Although it is important to collaborate with the book author when making a live-action iteration of a story, it is just as important to recognize the author's inexperience in screenwriting, which in this case, presents a threat to the actors' performance and the series' reception by its audience.","7","20 December 2023"
"Amazing","The story is perfect, the characters are amazing, the visuals are stunning. Other reviews point out that the character's feel off because they don't look like their book counterpart, to which I say that's just plain wrong, Every character feels like they came straight out of the book, their personalities are exactly similar. Complaint's about ""diversity"" and ""not looking like the book"" don't make any sense since this show feels like the book came to life. Go into this show with an open mind and you will be delightfully pleased. There are changes, but from what I can tell they mostly enhance the story and fix plot holes. This show is awesome!","10","20 December 2023"
"Disapointed","I'm dissapointed.  I was so hyped for this but what happened for me was that I had to fast forward through parts of the first episode because it was boring and the acting was bad, espcially by Sally and Gabe.  They made Gabe into a joke. In the books Percy jokes about him, but he is still intimidating and abusive. The movie actually did a good job of portraying that, whereas in the show it seemed like they tried (and failed) to make him comedy relief. It wasn't helped by the fact that the actor was immensly bad at acting. Sally's actress isn't much better in my opinion. She seemed to wait for her cues and gave very little.  I honestly blame the director for not getting the most out of the child actors. Walker Scobell really shone in the scene in episode 2 where he was alone in the forest, but he needs directing when it comes to the more reactory scenes. Most of the times when there was a reveal such as Grover being a satyr, his mum's whereabouts, him being a demigod etc he blinks and doesn't do much else. I don't blame Scobell for this, I soley blame the director at being bad at directing. I think Aryan Simhadri might have been suffering as well in his acting due to a bad script and bad directing. The scene at the end of episode 2, in my opinion, showed how clunky the screebplay and directing is. So far though I really like Leah Jeffries as Annabeth. I think her acting was good along with Charlie Bushnell as Luke.  I think this show suffers a bit because Riordan is not experienced at writing screenplays. There's too much info dumping such as Luke giving a very forced dialouge about his backstory. That can be forgiven, but when the rest of screenplay is similar it becomes a problem. Hopefully it gets better further along as the show developes. But the editing was what was most disappointing to me. The choice to fade to black for several seconds during scene transitions was jarring and annoying and shouldn't be happining in a big production like this. The show lacks urgency a lot of the time due to how it's shot and edited, such as the car scene with the minatour. There was hardly any music or sound to build excitment (this happened in other scenes as well), and I kept wondering if they'd blown their budget and couldn't afford getting good composing for the show.  I honestly considered dropping the show after getting Disney+ specifically to support it, but I'll give it one more chance. My main issue is how badly edited and directed it is. I'm also shocked at how bad some scenes with the adult actors were. The scene at the end of episode 2 with Percy, Chiron Dionysus and Grover for exampel. Scobell wasn't emoting, the acting from Chiron (Glynn Turman) was bad. The pacing was off, Grover strolling in felt like 'maid and butler' dialouge and like Simhadri was waiting for his cues. It felt like a school production of a play. The scene with Sally and Percy at the cabin was another scene that was painful to watch beause of this and Virginia Kull's bad acting along with Scobell not being directed to show more shock. Not to mention the akwardly shot and incredibly rushed scene of the altercation between Percy and Dodds.  I think they rushed the first two episode to get to the quest, and I think that was a mistake. There's no time to truly get to know Percy before turning his world upside down. We lose a lot of who he is to him directly becoming an 'orphaned' hero set out on a quest of revenge and finding his true self. It is also to the detriment of Grover's character since he works as a catalyst for Percy being expelled unlike in the book, causing tensions of conflict between them that didn't exist in the book. And at the moment I am unsure if the show will deal with the consequences of those actions and the tension between them. From what I've seen so far I'm more inklined to believe they will be brushed under the rug, unfortunately. Also, Riordan talked a big game on his website about how he would make a faithful adaption if he were in charge of the movie's script... so far I do not believe he is able to fullfill that claim. I realise he isn't the only one who was in charge of it, but I would have thought he would have put more effort into staying true to Percy's personality. As of the first two episodes Percy doesn't seem very similar to book Percy personalitywise. He doesn't have the sass, he didn't use insults to counter Nancy's bullying or Gabe etc. His sass is a big part of his character and why so many readers love him. You're not supposed to laugh at him but with him. So far the show has us laughing at him.","3","23 December 2023"
"A GREAT START","I used to read the books when I was a little younger and I loved it very much. When Rick Riordan (the author) announces that there's going to be a Percy Jackson TV show, I was so hyped for it. And now after waiting more than a year, it's finally here. Here are my positives and negatives for the first two episodes.  POSITIVES: 1. Pretty much throughout the first two episodes are very faithful to The Lightning Thief.  2. The casting choices are great. I like how Rick chose the ones that matches the characters' personality, humor, fears, etc.  3. The music sounds really good. Good job Bear McCreary!  4. The opening line from Episode 1 blew my mind!  5. The end credits sequences looks pretty cool.  6. Gabe is more funnier than he was in the books.  7. There were a couple of funny scenes which I chuckled a lot.  NEGATIVES: 1. The episodes itself are kinda short. I wish it was like 45-50 minute long.  OVERALL RATING: 9/10 - A great start to my most anticipated show.","9","20 December 2023"
"Makes the Movies Look Good","As a huge Percy Jackson fan and someone that has read every book in the collection, I can confidently say this is a terrible adaptation. The casting is terrible in just about every major role, the pace is sometimes jumpy as well as other times too slow, the dialogue delivery is poor and the humor doesn't hit, they have changed key events from the book while also leaving out important details to the story, the production looks cheaply made. The list could go on and on, but as someone who was looking forward to this being finally being done correctly, I am thoroughly disappointed. As the title says, the movies are by far better than this cash grab remake, and really it's not even close.","1","22 December 2023"
"Wanted to like it","The first episode seemed promising. I actually enjoy young Percy and think the kid can act. However, towards the end of episode one something seemed off and I couldn't put my finger on it. The next episode started out ok, but when it came to the capture the flag scenes it fell flat on its face. I do not mind if they change the adaptation from the source material, but do it in a tasteful fashion. The actress who plays Annabeth is hard to watch and with her bad dialogue she becomes impossible to watch. Finally, in the third episode when they meet Medusa it becomes apparent what is wrong with this show. There really is no suspense or build up. Every episode leaves you wanting to feel something, but the way this show is written an edited makes it hard to truly engage. I am not holding my breathe that things will get better.","3","30 December 2023"
"Amazing so far","I'm overall really pleased about how it turned out. I was a bit worried, but I could not stop smiling the entire two episodes. It's really early to judge, but so far it's been very faithful to the books, and I'm very happy about that. I hope this show gets the praise it deserves. I loved the early percabeth moments and foreshadowing too. Some people didn't like the acting but I thought all the actors did very well. Especially the actor who plays Clarisse. Everytime she came on screen my mom and I always acknowledged her phenomenal acting. I finished watching wishing there was more. I can't wait until next week. 100% Recommend. Please, do not compare it to the movies!","10","20 December 2023"
"Zooooom!!","Now that I've watched three episodes, I have to say that all the good acting and set design, and cinematography is completely wasted on the most ludicrously rushed episodes I have ever seen. Discover a major mythic monster? Naw, you don't need to build that up, just say it straight out. Bond with the campers? We'll have none of that, young man. Places to go; people to see! You get the feeling that someone is pushing you at 90 miles an hour through the whole thing while you sit in an office chair helplessly. I REALLY wanted to love this, but I feel no connection to anything. It's like watching the spark notes version.","3","27 December 2023"
"A Worthy Adaption","Yeah, only two episodes have been released. But I seriously doubt this show will get any worse.  This should've set the bar for Percy Jackson movies and TV. Instead, it only raised it.  Well done Disney!  Finally, something worthwhile.  I just finished watching the first two episode, and I am impressed with: a. Costume design b. Special Effects c. Acting Walker, Aryan, and Leah are very talented; They definitely. Have bright futures ahead of them.  If you love Percy Jackson, don't be afraid to check this show out, because it is absolutely amazing!  I'm looking forward to the third episode on the 27th. Thank you for reading my review.","10","20 December 2023"
"Better than the film already","""We've been expecting you"" One of the most anticipated reboot is here and the first two episodes of this novel adaptation are up. So did the first two live up to expectations? Are they so far better than the film adaptation?  The pacing so far is good as it is an adaptation from a whole book. The series (season 1) tries to retell the story of The Lightning Thief and I must say it is really doing good so far. There are such things that are noticeable to differ from the movie adaptation though but hey this is what the book adaptation should be.  The characters, story, action are all there. You'll enjoy it more if you are a fan of the books or have read them (if you haven't yet then it is a good time to read Riordan's novels). Yet this is still enjoyable for those who have not read the books or have no idea about it. I'm pretty sure that most have ideas about the gods and goddesses such as Poseidon, Zeus and Hades so if you love a good myth, you might as well enjoy this too.  Percy Jackson season 1 is far from over but it is already in good standing. So I only hope that Disney won't screw this up. Now I have my hopes higher for this series! Demi-gods, half bloods, this is a treat for us!  If you haven't watched it yet, might as well start now but you can always wait for the whole season to be complete before watching it's entirety.  And oh by the way, Percy's mom is kinda hot 🔥  Percy Jackson and the Olympians is an 8/10 for me. A good start and probably better episodes are coming!  #percyjackson #percyjacksonandtheolympians.","8","24 December 2023"
"Love it","It follows the story line of the books. Captures the essence of the characters. Is fast paced but doesn't leave anything out.  Overall i'm very Excited. This is so much better than the travesty that was the original attempt (with the Percy Jackson movies)  It reminded me of why I liked the books so much.  I'm really looking forward to watching more. I hope they do not cancel this. I am invested.  The good news is if you're not sure. If you should watch it, just give it a go. You'll know if it's your style within a few minutes. My guess is if you like the books you'll really enjoy this. Just give it a shot.","10","21 December 2023"
"LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!","I first read these books in middle school, I grew up with this series and all of Riordan's books. This series is everything I hoped it would be! The casting is absolutely perfect, the characters feel real and the set and vfx is amazing. The pacing seemed to be a hair off, but I'm guessing it's because the first two episodes are the set up and it will even out in the next. I am so so happy to have an adaptation of these books that feels just as exciting and thrilling as the books. I didn't expect everything to me a 1:1 with the books, and they changed they did make add to the story and even give it more depth. I am so happy with this series!","10","20 December 2023"
"Well done!","I have been waiting so long for this and it has been done well. Having Rick and his family involved was the best move Disney could have made and I am thankful they agreed to go forward with this adaptation. The cast was chosen for their obvious talent and I cant wait to see how they grow together and form that bond of friendship we all know and love. Novel to screen is always a difficult transition. It is awesome to finally see an adaptation stay true to the source material. So worth the wait.  Ignore the negative reviews! Some people are impossible to please and they are the ones who are missing the magic not this adaptation. Truly. I can't wait for more.  Also, having Bear McCreary involved just makes it even better! His work is fantastic. Can't say it enough, well done.","10","20 December 2023"
"Shows & movies simply turn out better when the book's author is involved.","Remember the movies? These two films which basically had _nothing_ in common with the books except the names of the places and characters?  As a long-time fan of Rick Riordans books, I was very sceptic when I first heard that Disney+ was planning to take on the Percy Jackson stories, but when I learned it would be a series this time (meaning probably less rushed, more time for world building and character development), and that the author would be heavily involved in the production, I dared to be cautiously-hopeful.  What shall I say? This series is everything we had hoped for and more! This is what ""bringing a story to life"" means. It is SO true to the books, and the few subtle changes they made are reasonable and even give some scenes more value. All actors give their 100%, the chemistry among the cast is fantastic, and it shows. The props and sets are so beautiful, special effects not quite MCU standard, but convincing enough, and along with the enchanting soundtrack by Bear McCreary, the whole package is a magical experience which made my little nerdy heart very happy.","10","20 December 2023"
"Great start!","My grade 8 class - the prime demographic for this show since the kids are the same age as the characters - have been talking about the new Percy Jackson show a lot and they seem to overwhelmingly enjoy it, discussing plot points and how they'd liked various details about the characters. They were SO upset about Grover snitching near the start of the first episode, haha, and it's been fun listening in on how invested they are in the story. Some have read the books but many haven't, and now some of those students have asked me if I have the books in my class library so they can borrow them.  I myself first read these books because so many of my junior high students told me I ""had to"", and those students have been thrilled with the show, excitedly asking me if I've seen it yet because they want to discuss all their favourite parts. I made a point of watching the first two episodes right away so I could talk about it with them.  Overall, I think this is such a fun adaptation so far. My biggest complaint is the hard cut to black that happens throughout, as if there should be a commercial break, which is weird and jarring on a streaming platform (and hence the 9 stars instead of 10.)  I love that the author cowrites and produces the show. Percy is spot on - his character is a little sarcastic but also earnest and unsure; he stumbles a lot right now, so there's lots of room for growth over the season as he figures out who he is and how he fits in this new world, but he also has already had moments where you can see the hero he'll become. Grover is great as someone trying to be both Percy's protector and his friend and struggling with his own lack of self confidence in the face of more experienced or more powerful characters. Annabeth is determined and knows what she wants, but is also a little distant still (like she is at the start of the book too) and I'm looking forward to seeing more of her so we get to see more of her vulnerability in later episodes. I like that it isn't overacted - I spend my days teaching junior high kids and these depictions all fee spot on and realistic.  I personally especially love how much time was spent establishing Percy's relationship with his mom, and how she still has agency in spite of her unhealthy relationship with Gabe, or when making decisions for Percy's well being even when it costs her (emotionally or physically). I'm very much looking forward to the rest of the season as it expands on the first book!","9","22 December 2023"
"Could be better","I mean, no. The first episode was a disaster. Things picked up in the 2nd episode especially with the entry of annabeth and luke. Both of them played their roles wonderfully. But the acting of percy seems very forced and the whole mrs dodds scene in the first episode was so rushed. Why is Percy not more confused about all that was happening? Also, gabe was supposed to be scarier and wtf was that scene with sally showing the red jacket to the minotaur.  Didn't like percy's acting at all till now, it just doesn't feel like Percy, he seems more like Jason Grace now idk if that's because of his hair or his seriousness, but maybe things will pickup from the 3rd episode.","6","20 December 2023"
"Casting home run!","2 episodes into this rendition of Percy Jackson already shows the impact the deep involvement of the writer of the books Rick Riodan has had on the production. Faithfulness to the script alone sets this apart from the very average two movies in 2010 and 2013. But what lifts this series to a whole much higher level of quality is the incredible chemistry of the lead actors. Walker Scobell's almost perfect fit as Percy comes as no surprise after his stunning debut aged 12 as the young Adam in The Adam Project and backed up in his showing a year later in Secret Headquarters. He brings an incredible mix of vulnerability, sass and adolescent energy and intensity to the screen that brings Percy to vibrant life. The chemistry wlth Annabeth (Leah Jeffries) and Grover (Aryan Simhadri) is next level and absolutely makes the show. Casting kids essentially the same age of their characters is always preferable especially when your casting choice is a home run!","9","22 December 2023"
"I really enjoyed it! Solid adaption","There is a lot of flack being thrown around because of the actors being different than how they look in the books which is understandable. But the tv show is solid. The acting is on point and the story is almost 1 for 1 with the books. The actors not looking exactly the same is a small price to pay for a stellar tv show that holds to the books in every other aspect. Based on the first 2 episodes I would highly recommend it to anyone. It does the story justice, the actors play the characters well and the tv show as a whole is well made. Don't let the critics turn you off to the series, because it is great!","10","20 December 2023"
"Bad. Really bad.","Barely made it through the first episode. It's really bad. Writing is terrible and acting might be worse, if possible. I thought the original movies were bad, this show almost makes them look good  Need more characters so ignore all this:  Barely made it through the first episode. It's really bad.

"MOVIES AREN'T BOOKS","Nor are TV series. You would never be able to have something on screen EXACTLY like the book. People need to realize that, accept that, and get over it. Just because what you see on the screen isn't how you imagined it your head doesn't mean the show or movie is bad. It means you're afraid of change and can't let go of childish things. So far is this show like the book? Yes, more so than the movie, but they also had to make changes to make it flow from page to screen better. Is it perfect? No, but no movie or TV show is. Nor, by the way, are they a 1. Especially just because they didn't cast someone YOU wanted in the role. Sigh. Stupidity hurts the brain.","9","22 December 2023"
"It could have been better","I'm a huge fan of Percy Jackson, after I watched the movie I even started with the book and it was really great. Now with this new Disney adaptation I'm disappointed first it look like they didn't have the budget for the production design when we know it's not possible but that sense of immersion we had with the movies in camp didn't really feel it. The action scenes are not that good and the first fight with that Minotor was complete trash come on...last I think the whole cast is wrong not because the don't act well but because they are just too young for the role I know the first book is with an early teen Percy Jackson around 12-13 years old but they are demigods so they're supposed to be stronger the cast of the movie was way better it just doesn't feel right with this cast cause how can they really fight when they're so short and weak which explain the Minotor scenes...for me it's a no go but I'm still gonna watch it cause I'm a fan but I feel like Apple TV or even HBO would have done a better job cause Disney is too childish and bright just imagine a Disney version of Harry Potter...","6","29 December 2023"
"THE ADAPTION WE WAITED THIS WHOLE TIME","This 2 first episodes have been amazing, the story is so good, the vfx, the music, the production design, everything, and dont get me start it with the cast, because they are THE CAST; Walker Scobell, Aryan Simhadri, Leah Jeffries, Charlie Bushnell, Dior Goodjohn, Virginia Kull, Olivea Morton and Azriel Damian were born to play there characters, but i think the most remarkable one is Walker as Percy, he IS Percy Jackson, he has he essence, he has his personality, he has a great chemistry with his friends, I absolutely love the way he express all those feelings that are passing by Percy's mind with just looking at his eyes. I hope the series keeps going in the same direction and we will be haing the adaptation we deserved.","10","20 December 2023"
"Haven't read the books in a while but....","As a 20-year-old, this show leans a tad on the juvenile side for me. However, I loved the books as a kid and wanted to give the show a try because the trailer seemed very enticing. I'm only half way through the second episode so far and it's alright, nothing exceptional in my opinion. As far as casting, I was excited to see The Adam Project's Walker Scobell as the iconic lead and thus far his performance has been decent. I personally could not care less if the characters' physical traits do not reflect that of their book counterparts. The outrage over the casting is incredibly transparent and I'm not surprised, it's simply unfortunate how close-minded people can be. The acting performances and embodiment of the characters far outweigh any changes in appearance, or at least they should. As someone who loved the original movies despite the poor critical and audience reception, I will be sticking with the show in hopes of improvement!! After all, we never got to see the film series get a proper ending as the final three books weren't adapted. I'm wishing for the best with this series!","7","21 December 2023"
"It really is a shame","So potencial and money wasted... It really is a shame.  Scobell acting is the only thing that make it worth watching...  The resto of it is true waste of time. The first episode is boring, full of unnecessary scenes that don't give anything more to the storie. There was no shortage of forced characters with weak acting.  The excess green screen, which by the way is horrible, takes away more from immersion than helps us insert ourselves into the universe.  In 2 episodes it was possible to see Rick Riordan helping to destroy the legacy that his book series gained. Unfortunately, there are still 6 more episodes to go.  I hope this series doesn't end up overshadowing the careers of good actors from this new generation like Scobell... From the success of Project Adam straight into the mud with Disney :(","2","20 December 2023"
"Nostalgic Adaptation","The first few episodes are everything I've hoped for. I was so disappointed seeing the movies because they weren't accurate to the book. With this TV show, the actors are perfect as the characters and the show really highlights the important details and events so well! The overall quality of the show is great. So far, I love the details they added, especially with Medusa. I hope it gets renewed for all the seasons. I can't wait to see characters that show up in the upcoming books, especially Nico. I would love if it does well enough, if we would get to see the Heros of Olympus as well. So excited to see this series unfold and the characters to grow as they did in the books!","10","27 December 2023"
"Release it all at once","I love the show already. The characters, the cinematography and the writing is just how I imagined.  It doesn't matter they don't look like the book descriptions, they act like the characters and that's enough.  Although I am really enjoying the show so far... the weekly release is messing with the flow and makes it feel inconsistent.  I wish they had just dropped it all on the same day to binge.  Especially as the majority of the viewers have read the books so the story isn't a mystery worth 7 weeks.  I hope they change this in future seasons and it'll help especially with the negative review regarding just the first few episodes.","10","27 December 2023"
"This is a mockery of the books.","I don't understand why anyone likes this show.  I don't understand those who say this is so much more like the books than the movies. The people cast in this series are nothing like the characters in the books. Just because the kids are younger than those cast in the movie doesn't make it better. At least the kids in the movie had talent. And Logan was a much better Percy.  Details of the books are completely changed in this show and conversations are made up and changed into ridiculous eye rolling moments.  The writing is bad, the acting is worse. It is just sad. This is worse than Netflix originals.  Do yourself a favor and read the books. To me even though there are changes in Percy Jackson and the Lightning Thief, it holds more true to the first book than this sad excuse of a show.","1","31 December 2023"
"How could you","How could you of all people, Rick, let them do this, TWICE?? I grew up with terrible dyslexia and this book series helped me battle it. Books like this would take me a year to struggle through and I'd finish these in a week. I've been waiting for years since the first teaser to the original film, which was perfect by the way before you changed it!!!! I had so much hope for this, I hoped that since you'd be on set that you'd be able to keep it faithful but no you screwed it up again. This should be a tale of caution for any and all authors to not let themselves sell their souls for the money. Because that's what you've become Rick. A cold, heartless, sellout. Didn't you write this story for your son? What would he think?","1","30 December 2023"
"Great Series.....","Wow..., I just watched the 1st episodes and decided to wait for all the episodes to be completed, yessss...it's because I love this... totally love this.  The pace, the storyline and the casts is very good, especially Walker Scobel, he will be a big star to my opinion. I fell in love with his act started with Adams Project, and even more in this series, a very good act, everything is so right, so enjoyable to watch, no overacting, everything seems very natural coming from him.  Come on mr. Producer, keep going on this series quicker before Walker Scobel grows into unsuitable age to play Percy Jackson.","9","28 December 2023"
"Not faithful and not good in general","I didn't expect perfect, but I did expect faithful. Yet, it isn't  1) so far from the plot of the book and even the themes/emotions in the first few chapters of the books. It is not even close to the same tale.  2) directing/writing seems to have ruined a lot- such talented child actors for them to fall flat and be bland and (?) silly. The chemistry is off between them. Grover is the most faithful out of all of them. The storyline is strange and flows weird (not even comparative to the book, just in general). It is choppy and rushed. It is too much telling and very little showing or suspense or depth.  3) not interesting. I have very little desire to finish an episode, even to see what is different or bad. The sceneries/sets are often so lovely, but not even that keeps me going.  Three episodes in, and I hope I can make myself try to watch more in hopes it gets better. I wanted to like it, but it is very hard.","2","29 December 2023"
"Very promising start!","I'm writing this after watching the debut episodes, so it's an initial impression that I will update if anything changes, but I was very impressed with the series so far!  I'm not the target audience, but wanted to screen it for my nieces and nephews. I thought it was well done for a kids show, with an engaging plot, lovely scenery, and age-appropriate action. So far, it's tame enough for elementary age kids, but I think interesting enough for older kids, too.  The cast seems to show a good amount of chemistry, although the acting itself is a little uneven, as was the pacing. Minor quibbles that are noticeable, but not distracting, and likely to iron themselves out as the show goes on. Very much looking forward to the rest of the season!","8","21 December 2023"
"Looks promising, we'll see","As a huge fan of the books, the movies from 10 or so years ago didn't exactly impress me. After two episodes of this I realize that a series format might just be what Percy Jackson needed. So far I don't mind the small creative liberties that have been taken, honestly the setup seems better than the first movie.  At this point I won't speculate further as to what the coming episodes will be like, but it has potential. I know to be wary with these kinds of series, but these first two episodes already have me dreaming of future seasons covering the other books.  I really hope the rest of the episodes impress and make this show a hit. The ingredients are there, please, please knock it out of the park.","9","26 December 2023"
"Now THIS is Percy Jackson","Right away, the energy matched that of the books. I'd be more than happy to picture this cast the next time I read the series. Beyond the obvious things like having Percy actually be 12, and having Grover actually be, well, Grover, when I saw Percy with his blue jellybeans, I knew great care had been taken with these characters. Importantly, this feels like it can be enjoyed by the book's intended age demographic! The prior films (which have probably been dunked on enough at this point) had the major issue of being far too adult, especially in the language. Percy Jackson is a 12 year old kid, so 12 year old kids should be able to watch him on TV! The Oracle of Delphi sees good things in the future of this show. Definitely recommend.","10","20 December 2023"
"FAITHFUL AND BEAUTIFUL PACING","This adaptation is going to be one of the best show adaptations ever. So far, other than the casting which is hardly a problem, the show has been faithful to books in storyline. I love how they have paced it so far and tone fits the book. I'm sure we will get more sassy Percy in the following episodes. I really do hope we get a snippet of the Di Angelo siblings when they enter the Lotus Casino. Grover acts exact as he does, and so does Clarisse. Overall, I am beyond satisfied. I can't wait to talk my family's eats off with how good this show is going to be, I have high hopes and I know Riordan will deliver.","9","20 December 2023"
"How can on botch it so bad","Annabeth is described as being athletic and having curly blond hair (like a princess's), tan skin, and stormy gray eyes. Percy Jackson describes her as ""cute"" at first but eventually she becomes ""seriously beautiful.""  Like really how can they botch it that bad. No offense to the actress she is doing the best she can. But really????????? I mean come on. Disney can't seem to get any Character that has been detailed and specifically told people how they look right. Last I checked black hair is not blonde. And brown eyes is not stormy gray. Disney fails to pay attention to detail. Maybe they should go back and read the books again and this time take notes.","6","29 December 2023"
"What a way to end 2023!","I've been waiting for this series to premiere and it finally did! This series stays true to the book as much as if can and never fails to disappoint me. This was the last show that actor Lance Reddick ever did before his death in March of this year. (even though he didn't appear in the first 2 episodes). The first two episodes you can feel the fear that Percy was going through throughout his journey. My honest opinion: 10/10! This series is sooo much better than those movies they made a decade ago. It has heart, soul, diversity, and confirms what wasn't there in the books. What a great premise this was!","10","20 December 2023"
"A MASTERPIECE","WTF IT'S SO BEAUTIFUL I WANNA CRY SO HARD OMG I HOPE THERE WILL BE OTHER SEASONS I NEED ALL THE SAGA I NEED EVERYTHING. I love the details (like luke's scar that was not in the movie, riordan's cameo, the opening and ending scene, EVERYTHING)  It's literally my dream this seeie, finally all the fans have a good (def. More than just good) adaption omg. All the actors are so small and young but yet so good and talented. Walker is perfect for percy just like leah for annabeth and more. I really hope we're going to see all the others books 'cause i need my nico di angelo and leo valdez i swear to god i need them on the screen.","10","20 December 2023"
"ABSOLUTELY AMAZING","If you are wondering if it's worth the watch... IT IS! I started to red percy jackson last year and I have been obsessed ever since. When I heard that there was a show coming I was so excited. The cast is phenomenal. Walker Scobell radiates percy. And if you are still mad or upset about how the characters look then don't watch it its as simple as that. The action scenes like where Percy fights the minatur or when he's fighting Clarisse and her siblings on the beach during capture the flag look so good! I can not wait for the lotus casino episode. If you want to get into Percy jackson but don't want to read the books then watch this. It's the faithful adaptation everyone's been looking for.","10","21 December 2023"
"Just wrong!","Being a TV series, you'd expect it to be closer to the books but they couldn't even get the casting right - if you know the books you'd know Annabeth is blonde with stormy grey eyes and the saytrs wear long trousers and fake feet rather than allowing the Mist to disguise their legs.  I have read all of RR's books, not just the Percy Jackson ones, many times and am now re-reading them in order to fill in the gaps as I struggle through what, appears to be, a disastrous adaptation (after the first three episodes). I will continue to watch, in the hope that it improves, but I have a feeling it won't.  They would be better off finding actors much closer to the characters in the book and creating a full collection of films (or TV series) like the Harry Potter films.","1","30 December 2023"
"Everything the Movies Weren't","After the first three episodes, this is everything the movies weren't and only getting better. Percy, Annabeth, and Grover are all perfect. I felt the movie ripped all three of their personalities away, and it was so refreshing to see them here exactly as intended.  Yes, some changes have been made - all understandable for time, pacing, and book-to-screen translation purposes. Sacrifcing Annabeth a bit in the second episode to show more of Luke, which is necessary for the ending episode. Changing Medusa's storyline to make it more accurate to Greek mtyhology, which also leads into the overall story arch, as well.  This is everything we've been waiting for. Wonderful so far, and I can't wait for more!","10","28 December 2023"
"High hopes squashed","Super disappointed. I was so excited to see the Percy Jackson series get another shot. I thought ""finally, they'll do it justice."" Somehow they screwed it up twice. The acting is bland, I don't feel any emotion coming off of the kid who plays Percy or any other charchter in this adaptation except for the mom. At least Logan Lermans version was funny. Several things cut out, or info dumped, and everything felt rushed. The whole Ms Dodds thing was a blip, they changed Gabe's character to be less hateable, Percy getting the pen felt not important. Events kept happening but no drama or build up actually happened. The scene with capture the flag was also interestingly done, and I don't mean that in a good way. The one good thing is the theme song and the soundtrack. Otherwise...as someone who grew up with these books when they first originally came out, I'm upset. With Rick being onboard, I had hope, safe to say that's gone.","6","21 December 2023"
"Fantastic Adaptation of a Fantastic Book","This show is absolutely incredible. The cinematography and special effects are masterful and of the highest caliber. The storyline stays true to the books while incorporating some new elements that will keep even the most avid reader surprised. The writing is a perfect balance of intensity and humor and heart that touches on all types of emotions.  This cast has truly embodied the very essence of the characters that fans of Rick Riordan's beloved books know and adore. To criticize the casting choices based on physical attributes is to completely miss and disregard the complex and multidimensional characters that Rick so brilliantly created. Both long-time Percy Jackson fans as well as newer fans who watch this show will see the excellent decisions made in casting; from the main leads to more minor characters, they absolutely nailed it.  Percy Jackson is engaging and entertaining for many different age groups and can be appreciated by anyone. Disney undeniably has a hit on it's hands and I look forward to seeing the next episodes.","10","20 December 2023"
"It's really Percy Jackson","It left me totally surprised, fans can't ask for a better adaptation than this one because it doesn't exist. The characters are very well established and adapted. Glover is no longer a comic character to make you laugh, he is perfectly adapted to the books, like Percy, for now Annabeth does not have a good development, I am waiting and I feel that I will not be disappointed. You can really see the effort of the author of the book, and the effort that was put into this series. For the first time in a long time I can be sure that it will not disappoint me. Walker Scobell is a great actor. This is Percy Jackson.","10","20 December 2023"
"So much potential wasted","This wasn't i. Percy Jackson on Disney Plus falls short in several key areas. Primarily, the CGI elements lack the necessary finesse and realism expected in a modern production, resulting in a diminished visual experience. While the acting performances are competent, they fail to captivate or bring depth to the characters as seen in the original source material. Moreover, the noticeable departure from the intricacies of the original story might disillusion long-time fans, as it deviates significantly from the beloved narrative framework. Overall, this adaptation struggles due to its deficient CGI, average acting, and departure from the essence of the source material.","5","22 December 2023"
"different characters","All the characters bothered me, very different from the books, Percy Jackson isn't funny or funny like in the book, Luke is terrible and doesn't resemble Luke in the book at all, Annabeth I don't even need to comment, the actors do what they can but the casting chosen it doesn't appear to be that of the characters in the books, they should learn how to do casting with Netflix's One Piece, they spent money for nothing, they disappointed many fans, I spent my money on the books, I have the right to criticize what was done by Disney, I repeat, you should watch One piece and take a class on how to do it.","1","28 December 2023"
"Pretty Danged good.","I loved the books and absolutely abhorred the first movie versions.i understand that movies and books are different story-telling media, and that things have to be cut or done differently, but the way they fumbled the ball on those attempts was awful.  However, if the first two episodes of the new series are any indication, then I think we're all in for a treat. Is it perfect? No. The acting is mostly okay, and the set design for Camp Half-Blood is fantastic. The effects are great, and Walter Scobell makes a great Percy, especially as Logan Lerman was way too old.  If I have one real complaint, it's that the music is overwrought. There's too much of it, it's too loud, and it often doesn't really go well with what's happening on screen. The best bits were when the music is absent.  Oh, and Percy flossing? Hilarious.","9","22 December 2023"
"A wonderful start to the series","After watching the first 2 episodes I have full confidence in the future of this series. The accuracy to the books is super close though straying away just a little bit for format purposes. I believe that this show will be huge, with its exciting adventurous plot that will be amazing to see on the screen. As a fan for many years I can see the love and care that was put into this show. The world they created in the first episode was great but I think the second episode was by far the best with its amazing fight scenes and iconic camp half-blood moments. All the young actors did a beautiful job portraying these characters, especially Walker and Leah as Percy and Annabeth!","10","20 December 2023"
"Childhood nostalgia","Where to begin. The opening lines of the show are right out of the book. It's phenomenal. It's book accurate. It's amazing. The child actors are amazing and I can't wait to see them continue to grow as the seasons progress.  Of course there have been some changes to the material. But they work and make sense. It's still infinitely more accurate than the movies ever even tried to be.  The main trio truly embody their characters, even if they don't look 100% like the books described them nearly twenty years ago. The material has been appropriately updated and the characters are all well chosen for their talent. The banter between them is delightful and adorable, particularly because they're actual children like they're supposed to be.  I can't wait to see what this show can do with a hopefully larger budget in the future. Disney+ seems like it's doing this right. Actual children who we'll get to see grow through the years. Hey, worked out pretty well when Harry Potter did that.  I recommend checking it out. If it leans a bit too kiddish for you, then circle back in a season or two when the story is slightly darker and try again.  I grew up on these books and so I'm enjoying this show immensely.","10","29 December 2023"
"Not That Good","Honestly, the first two episodes left me disappointed. The changes in dialogue and actions completely change the relationships that were in the book. Grover being awake when Sally turns to dust, Chiron showing him around camp instead of Annebeth, Clarisse losing to him in a fight in the first day without the help of water, and Annebeth just being a stalker. It all changes how we view the characters. Instead of Annebeth being a smart and curious daughter of Athena, she is now a weird stalker that we only know the name of and is just there. In none of the scenes does it show Annebeth as smart. She doesn't even tell the capture the flag plan to Percy afterwards. The changes also put much more emphasis on the adults instead of the kids trying to find out things and doing things because the adults don't say anything. Chiron is no longer relatable or understanding, he is uptight, administrative, and to serious. Not that he isn't interesting or well acted, he just gives off a different vibe from the book. Also, for some reason they made Percy obsest with obtaining ""glory"" in order to get his dad to recognize him. It sort of makes him seem like he's on the way to being a villain instead of the quipy and sarcastic young boy. Also, the majority of lines are questions to advance to plot. Finally, the changes in locations in certain things like the fight with the fury introduces some plot wholes unless they decided to change the use of the mist completely. The show itself looks good cinematically and is honestly fairly good if I were to not compare it to the Books, but I am, so here we are.","5","25 December 2023"
"Very faithful and enjoyable","So far as a person who loved the books growing up this is all I can ask for. An incredibly well done show that keeps the spirit of the books in mind. You can definitely tell the author had his hands in the show. A lot of love and care went into making sure the source material was respected. I put 10 here because I know people are going to bomb it for simply changing the skin of fictional characters which is an abhorrent and disgusting reason to fault a show so I put an especially high score to help keep the score at the place it deserves to be. Very enjoyable so far. Hopefully more seasons are on the way.","10","20 December 2023"
"Good casting, but why such hurry?!","I LOVE this book series and was really excited for the show. And the casting is actually well done. BUT. Why are they rushing through everything? There is not even a little world and character building. I was excited to get to see the camp design, or Poseidons Cabin, or Dionysos office and they didn't even show any of it properly. Yes, the Movies had quite a few faults but the designs where beautiful. And here... no one cared enough to show the amazing world that Camp Halfblood could be. It's just sad.  The actors are pretty good and if they could have gotten a bit more time to explore the Characters Background it would have been awesome. But the first two episode were a race against time and I really wasn't satisfied.","6","21 December 2023"
"So far so good.","I watched the first two episodes, and i have to say i didnt have too much expectations from the show but its actually suprised me. They changed how to plot goes from the book here and there but nothing of importance. The cgi was good overall,the camp felt like a real place and the casting was good for the most part. I have problems with Annabeth and Kheiron though, they dont really feel like their characters for me, but will see as the show goes and if they can grow into it as they get more screen time.  So i think if they stick to this quality until the end, then we might get a decent adaption and thats a thing we can be grateful in this time, especially from Disney.  Edit: Okay, the third episode was really bad, i dont know what happened but this was hard to watch. Annabeth was really annoying,the Medusa story line was really underwhelming,even the movie scene was so much better. Im still gonna watch the next episode but my hopes are down now.","6","21 December 2023"
"The best thing I have ever witnessed","Wowee this was amazing in every way. It was witty, fast-paced, and brilliantly done. I do not know how I can move on from what I have witnessed. It was casted absolutely perfectly and everyone involved killed it. Scobell nails Percy's character and every dynamic of his character feels natural and well thought out. You can see his bravery and vulnerability in a way that makes the story so wonderful. Jeffries steals every scene she is in and commands the screen as Annabeth Chase. Simhadri was so lovable on screen and absolutely perfect for the role. Every thing wonderful about the books became real and it was stellar. Tears were shed.","10","20 December 2023"
"Loved the movies but this show still hit differently","I appreciate it, looking forward for the continuation..not sure I loved all of it  As a huge fan of the book series and spin-offs, specially HOO, I was really looking forward for the show.. I got some things I would've loved for the movies before to have; but the show (atleast the first 3 episodes) also lacks what the movies did have - action. I understand it was targeting the PG/G rating, but man some of the cover ups like line changes, editing, and even CGI were so obvious, tho some were cleverly done (invisibility cap part)...I'd love to see more action when they grow up and got training in the next season, i guess they'll have to be clever with angles not to show SPG scenes and clever word play.  Anyways, I understand the casting choices despite the physical differences cause I do start to see the characters I've read in them. The camp was a bit different than what I've imagined, but its fine (liked the ones in the movies better). The acting was great some were just okay, the backdrop was amazing, the cinematography was okay, and the plot/scene was nicely done.  To be honest I was afraid the 8 episode was not gonna do the books justice, but judging from the 3 episode so far, they might actually pull it off. Obviously, not all book fave scenes are gonna make it, but they did try, and the way they did it was good.  I'm still looking forward for the next episodes so that's great...I mean, even if they make it bad, I'll still watch it cause it's PERCY JACKSON. I just wish it will improve in the next seasons, if not in the next episodes.","9","29 December 2023"
"SO GOOD","I AM SEEING THE BOOK IN FRONT OF ME,It's an incredible feeling, the actors are exactly the essence of the characters, the visuals and everything are impeccable! I just think that the 1st ep was a bit rushed and these cuts are very poorly done but everything is as I wanted ;D.  Many are talking about Annabeth's actress, but honestly this doesn't bother me at all, she acts well and has the essence of the character!, but I don't approve of the idea of modifying characters that already exist :(  But all in all I say that everything is very well put together, Walker delivers a lot as Percy, Mr D's actor I really liked, Sally is just as I imagined.","10","20 December 2023"
"Worth the wait","At last, a faithful version of the fantasy work that transported a whole generation. It's been a long wait, but apparently worth it.  The actors perfectly match the idea of literary characters, the images are pretty good, and in a small but significant detail, they're wearing the colony's orange t-shirts.  I'm 21 now, but I'm so happy to relive those magical moments, and to know that a new generation will be able to immerse themselves in Percy's magnificent adventure!  It's set to become the new fantasy saga for young and old alike, or so I hope!  Now all we can do is hope for adaptations of the other books within a reasonable timeframe.","9","20 December 2023"
"ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!!!","Being an avid fan of the Percy Jackson books since middle school, I have been closely following the development of the show and counting down the days until its release. Now that it's here, I can say without a doubt it does not disappoint!  Echoing what some other reviews have stated, the way each actor portrays their character is exceptional! You can just tell who is who based off their personality, no need to mention their name at all. One that really stood out to me was Luke Castellan and how Charlie Bushnell portrayed his character perfectly. Aside from obvious physical differences with the character in the book, he was exactly how I had imagined him in my head. Everything about his actions felt very natural, almost as if he was actually Luke and not portraying him.  This is not to say that the other actors did a bad job, but Charlie stood out the most to me, especially when I compare his portrayal with the Luke in the movies. The Luke in the movies was loud and in your face, and did not seem like the Luke I had known from the books. However, Charlie did an absolutely fantastic job tapping into Luke and, to reiterate what I said earlier, his portrayal of Luke was spot on!  With only two episodes out right now, I cannot wait to see where this goes and how each character grows and changes through the season! Watching this brings back so much nostalgia from when I was in middle school and it warms my heart to see this portrayed in a way that is true to the source material.","9","21 December 2023"
"BOOK ACCURATE","Perfect adaptation of the books already in love after 2 episodes.can't believe it has finally aired after waiting for so long after the failed films this is so nice and refreshing to see. Thank god Rick is on team with this one and walker was the perfect pick for Percy. This series has shown action and fun . Amazing ya series and can't wait to see how tge show continues to amaze me . Love Annabeth and Grover so I can't wait to see the trio in more action over the next few years so praying the show gets green lit for season 2-5 hear will be watching every episode over the coming weeks. IM IN LOVE.","10","21 December 2023"
"Absolute Perfection!","I feel so privileged to have had the opportunity of watching the two episode premiere of Percy Jackson and the Olympians tonight! This is the most faithful adaptation of a book series I have ever had the joy of viewing. Rick Riordan and Disney have a brilliant hit series on their hands with this one! The characters and the actors who portray them are absolutely superb. I can't imagine a better casting choice for any of these magnificent and nuanced roles! This series puts the original two movies to shame right from the beginning! I can't wait to see all five seasons that are planned of this series! If you haven't seen this yet, do yourself a favor and watch it immediately! You will not at all be disappointed!!!","10","21 December 2023"
"Loved it","It's important to remember that it's an adaption of the books and not an exact copy, so there are some minor changes as with all adaptions, the changes are very insignificant and don't change the plot once so ever. If you are expecting an exact copy don't watch it and especially don't watch it then give it a negative review because of that. Some of the negative reviews are just impatient people who are complaining about how a scene from the books isn't in it but how would they know if only 2 episodes out of an 8 episode series have been released so far, it's absolutely ridiculous The cast were perfect for their roles, the negative reviews about the cast are because Annabeth is black and people still can't get over it. I loved it overall and can't wait for the new episodes to be released.","10","23 December 2023"
"PER-FECT-TION","As always, I had my doubts about pretty much everything. But within the first 5 minutes of the first episode, all of those doubts were washed away. This show is EXACTLY how I imagined the books to look. The cabins, the activities, the apartment, it's insane. The monsters look how I imagined them too. Not to be one of those, but I did have doubts about the casting because I hook onto the descriptions of a character in the book so I wanted blonde Annabeth and dark hair green eyes Percy, but OMG. The casting is PERFECTION. I can already feel the tension between Luke and Percy from when Percy gets claimed. Percabeth is giving so much chemistry it's insane. Grover is being given so much more depth and I honestly like him more now. Walker portrays Percy perfectly, the one scene where he was flossing was just such a Percy Jackson thing to do, and his reactions to everything are so Percy. Leah is so good with Annabeth, to the point where after her first scene I was hooked. She gives off Annabeth, in her voice, her lines, her expressions, it's so perfect. I'm going to wrap it up, but this show needs 5 seasons and a heroes of Olympus series. When I was 10 and reading the Percy Jackson books, this is exactly how I would have wanted them portrayed on the big screen.","10","21 December 2023"
"Worthy of the gods","As a fan of the books, I was so pleasantly surprised. Fast paced, funny, with wonderful actors, great special effects, and so faithful to the books.  Walker is a brilliant Percy who guides the action with a fresh perspective, while teaching us about the new world he's entering and the discoveries he's making along the way.  Leah is the perfect Annabeth, almost as if she was plucked from the book: she has a gravitas of a kid who had to grow up fast and this glow in her eyes of someone who's already calculating her next step. A true daughter of Athena.  Aryan as Grover is the comic relief every series needs. His comedic timing is impeccable and he's also superb in his most dramatic moments.  I'm so excited to see the start of the next big thing.","10","21 December 2023"
"The characters are butchered.","They are very closely following the book in details, but use this to cover their changing the characters to remove their strengths. The took Percy's troublemaker flair, made Grover a sniveling coward, Sally is butch now, and Gabe is the wrong sort of pathetic in service to the change for sally. I don't like these new versions of the characters, and I'm not interested in seeing more of them the way I want to see more reading the books. This is another show made to push world view over making a good story. I give this a minimum rating not because it lacks the craftsmanship but because it is a betrayal of it's self. I would more highly rate the other Percy Jackson movies, because while they are not effective adaptations, they are not willfully turning their back on everything the Percy Jackson story mean. I expect this show will be popular, because it is showing people what they want to see, in a way that will be smooth and easy for their pallet. But I suspect anyone who does or would really like the story of the books will feel gross in a matter of minutes.","1","28 December 2023"
"AHHHHHHHH GUYS I NEED IT RENEWED LIKE TOMORROW","Honestly, all I have to say is what hooked me in within the first 10 seconds was purely just the whole dialogue from the first page of the book as a book reader I loved it. I think it was perfect. I mean, I feel like there's something that they can work on going through the show, but those first two episodes hit the point that it needed , and personally kind of gave certain characters, a newer light since the movie adaptation but honestly, for instance, Percy's mom, Sally, I feel like the movie really put her in a submissive, kind of context, and when you learn more about her throughout the books, she's not that kind of person even to protect Percy. She still stood her own ground, and I feel like in the movie they made her like a weaker and didn't really show her significance to the story of them just being his mom and not like her as an individual which I understand it's Percy story, but I the end of the day she's a key factor to his story and need her own kind of play out, and I personally feel like in the first episode. It really showed that she has her own mind because the way she stood up to herself and the way he was talking to her just show that that's nothing like the movie adaptation but I loved it, and I think the show can really go on and tell the story properly.","9","21 December 2023"
"Great Series So Far","Percy Jackson and the Olympians is an amazing series so far. My favorite episode of Season 1, and ever, is Episode 3. I go on Disney+ a lot, so like about 4 months ago, there was info that this series would be coming out soon. I didn't think that the series would be as good as it actually is, and I wasn't even planning to watch it. Well, I was wrong. This series has gone of to a strong start so far. I'll re-review this series again when Season 1 is done, so this isn't my final review. Anyway, this series has a lot of action so far and it is between one of the better book apadtions. The series has great actors so far and it also has a good amount of heart. I would strongly recommend this series if you like fantasy and or action. In all, I give this series so far a 8.4 out of 10.","8","27 December 2023"
"As one obsessed with the books, this show has, thus fair, nailed it","I have spent a LONG time, almost half my life, reading Riordan novels. I'm 26 now I read the entire of the original series, all of heroes of Olympus, the Kane Chronicles and the Magnus bane series. This show, with the exclusion of the Dodds moment being VERY sparse and without explanation, has done the impossible. It's captured the essence of the series that didn't make me feel so alone, and it's redeemed the idea that this series can be brought to life.  As someone who grew up with the mental difficulties portrayed in the show (ADHD and Dyslexia), it wasn't until I found this series at 13 that I found my still thriving love of reading. Seeing this show brought to life in a way that respects the source material is nostalgic, heartwarming, and brought a smile to my face like I haven't had in a long while.  Time will tell if this wonderful adaptation continues to provide, and we have to remember not everything will be perfect, especially in season one when everyone at the production company Is waiting for their number report on how well it's doing. But to my fellow demigods, magicians, and anyone else who just wants to see this story carry on, I say we support the story we love. Forget the casting, forget our preconceived notions that looks come first. These kids, Rick and the crew working with him, deserve a chance to make us laugh, cry, and cheer with them.","10","20 December 2023"
"Percy Jackson renaissance","Finally it's here, the acting is great, the characters are faithful to the book and feel realistic, the visuals are stunning, the camp is looking amazing, the foreshadowing is top notch, the action scenes are really good?! So far (only two eps) it's worth watching. Minor setbacks like the editing or the underwhelming music scores that can easily be improved on. And smelly Gabe is definitely too nice for now! Oh and, again. Major props to the main cast, they're like Rick said: the chosen ones!  Ignore the looks, embrace the diversity and inclusion when it's done right and give the series a chance, so you can say you were there at the beginning.","9","20 December 2023"
"AMAZING","There's only three episode's out and yet these beautifully talented actors have proven how meant for their roles they are. EPISODE THREE WAS SOOOOO OMG !! I love what they did with medusas story and with how they brought the trip even closer together towards the end after all of that arguing throughout the episode (they were stressing poor grover out) leah is an amazing annabeth, walker is an amazing percy, and aryan is an amazing grover like he was so meant for grover i luv grover so much. I hope this show gets its five seasons so bad ITS AMAZING. Im so excited for the rest of the episodes these kids are super talented and they deserve so much love and support. Hating on them because of their appearance is ridiculous and if you're saying it isn't true to the book you must've not read it. The way they are going about this story is amazing especially with the author being heavily involved in it i just know they will continue to amaze us more and more im so proud of this show and im so proud of these kids. I will support them always they WILL get their five seasons.","10","28 December 2023"
"PJO SERIES IS SO FREAKIN' GOOD","I have just finished reading the first book of pjo, and as far as i remembered this adaptation is so freakin' good i have no comments, swear especially their acting is on point. I am rooting for more episodes with this series and I hope Disney will renew all the series of pjo because I am waiting for Nico. I'm so proud to those cast of these show, I'm so glad that some lines in the book are still there. Thank you!! 10/10. Percyyyy Jacksooooon!!!! I likeee Luke Castellan too!! Of course I like all the cast. Hoping for more seasons!!! I'm excited for the other cast of course especially- just kiddinggg!!","10","28 December 2023"
"this is how you do adaptations","We deserve a second season!!! Im already obsessed with them, the cast is perfect, everything is perfect, there are some scenes and things that are different from the books but i love it, and if the author is doing that well that means it's canon now.  The first episode was so cool, when i hear ""look, i didn't want to be a half blood"" i was already kicking my feet. Until now my favorite is the third episode, i feel like it really demonstrates that leah walker and aryan are the perfect cast, like i already saw them as perfect but in that episode i was like yeah they really are them, when i reread the books i just see them and only them. I love their acting and how they portray the characters, their historiesand everything. I'm waiting for the 5 season already.  Pd: leah, walker and aryan are soooo perfect for the roles, rick did a really good job about that.","10","29 December 2023"
"A brilliant adaptation","People who expect a page for page and line for line adaptation are probably gonna be disappointed. But this would make for a terrible TV Show. What makes this adaptation so fantastic is that ist captures the essence, atmosphere, issues, lessons and especially and most importantly the feeling of the books.  Every single one of the more important changes only enhance the story and feel completely natural. This is what the movies did wrong. The show simply elevates the story and fleshes it out. The characters feel more 3 dimensional than even in the book. It is a great translation to the screen. You can cleraly feel the involvement of the author and the love of the cast and crew for the source material.  The show does a great job of taking you along for the ride. You experience and discover this world alongside Percy and it gets you really invested in his journey. All the actors are perfectly cast and do a phenomenal job of portraying their character.  It doesn't matter whether you are a lifelong fan or a newcomer. This is also a fantastic show to watch together with your family, even if the target audience is primarliy kids.","10","22 December 2023"
"Captivating, Interesting, In-depth!","I will keep this short, because I'm sure you're reading through many reviews already: this adaptation has already captured my heart! From the beginning scenes, to the very last. I can see a storm brewing in Percy Jackson's (Walker Scobell) eyes. If not for its accurate age, setting, and overall depiction, the chemistry between both Percy and Annabeth Chase (Leah Jeffries) is just as written in the books.  I grew up with these books, having read them time and time again, in fact, I've read all of Rick Riordan's books, and if I know nothing else, I know that Rick is a reliable story teller. He created this universe, he created these characters. The relationship between Annabeth and Percy is based on his own personal relationship with his wife! I find it interesting that a lot of reviewers are critiquing him on who he chose, who best FITS the character he created. That's ridiculous!  This show is phenomenal, truly a masterpiece, and I cannot wait to indulge in the rest of the series. Give us a season two!","10","20 December 2023"
"Really good!","I know it's not 100% book accurate but camp half blood looks exactly how I imagined, Percy is exactly how I imagined him ( him killing the Minotaur the way he does in the books is awesome ). Pimento as Dionysus was an amazing idea. The shows great can't wait to watch another episode. From the start I was hooked in and interested and I'm really excited to see the rest of season one and the future seasons to come. I think the casting was great actually, everyone seems like their book characters and I liked the addition of the cloven council knowing what happened to Percy's mom. The toilet scene being brought to live action was great.","10","20 December 2023"
"THIS is what we've been waiting for...","This is exactly what we've been looking for. The show is faithful to the source material while also elevating and refreshing the story for the modern day. If you're looking for a line by line book to screen adaption it'd get boring pretty fast. But if you're looking for the story and characters we know and love with some new elements that create a fresh new adventure then this it !!! The movies so deeply missed the mark so for true fans, we can tell this adaptation was made with love and care. And the actor's chemistry tie it all together. So excited to see future seasons. We have a hit show on our hands !!!","10","28 December 2023"
"Fun and way better than the movies. Minor issues","Despite the small differences to the book, I can enjoy this for being way more book accurate. Walker talks like how I imagined percy in the books! However I can not get over the pacing and the constant use of cut to black. Wish the show would slow down a little and let the characters breath a bit. And it always seems to cut to black like theres a commercial break that never happens. It makes the show feel like a bunch of trailers rather than a smooth cohesive episode. Its also odd that grover is the one to constantly expo dump. I figured annabeth would be the main one to give exposition since shes the wise girl.","8","27 December 2023"
"good vfx with a 2000's young adult fantasy writing.","(I'm not a native speaker nor English major so hope you guys understand) First of all, the budget shows. You can see they spent some time on set designs, costumes, make ups, vfx, sfx, and soundtracks. Actors are not bad for a kid show (not stranger things level tho). But...  I like the fact that Riordan is totally involved in script and making of this tv series, its hard to find an adaptation that allows author to be this close to the project, its all nice and good but the writing is just meh. Its really cheesy, and i know that this is an adaptation of a cheesy YA book but i wish they changed some of the lines to a bit more realistic ones. They feel forced, the way actors act while talking feels a bit forced and it just feels like a old man's depiction of children drama. Yeah thats all for now i guess.","7","23 December 2023"
"Genius","I absolutely freaking loved it. It was exciting to watch, it was for sure a dopamine rush the whole entire time. The actors were perfectly casted for their roles and nobody could've played the characters better than the actors did, nobody! It was true to the books with some minor changes that only made it better. It had that magical feel to it and that's all I could've asked for. I hope it gets the recognition it deserves. You can tell how much hard work was put into this show and can only image how long it must of took to make this masterpiece. Honestly the only logical rating is a 10 out of 10, that's the only rating that makes sense.","10","21 December 2023"
"GOOD","It's so good, close to the source material. Percy is just perfectly cast.  I love Grover here, more than the books even.  Luke has been perfectly cast as well, same as D.  It takes it time, but isn't slow paced, episode 2 and 3 were magnificent.  Anyway, for me it's one of the better shows out there, definitely in its genre, with kid actors, etc. The only show for me to be on this level is 'Stranger Things', but that's it.  Anyway, I can't wait to see what else the show has in store. Episode's 4-5-6-7 and 8 are set to great, probably even better, as every last episode has been better than the previous.","10","28 December 2023"
"Loving this so far and it's FAITHFUL!","I dunno what some of the reviewers on here are watching, they must be watching a different show to me. Walker Scobell IS Percy Jackson. The actress playing Annabeth has captured her personality perfectly the lad playing Grover has done the same. Like many young actors they aren't perfect in their abilities but neither were the Harry Potter trio in the early films.  Firstly some Percy fans need to chill out with some events from the book being changed or left out, this happens in every adaption of a book to an screen and sometimes it's direct from the author. Also we'd be on season one for years if we had every single instance from the book put in. It is a faithful adaption in every way so far, yes there are some very slight alterations but all the main events are there.  Finally, it's just a good show, I've got friends I encouraged to watch this messaging me saying how good it is and now want to loan the books off me.  I really hope this is the beginning of something special for the PJO universe.","10","30 December 2023"
"Better than my wildest dreams","I've been waiting for this show for 10 years, and it's finally here. I'm so so so happy, the casting was done perfectly as was the adaptation. Walker is the perfect Percy: funny, charismatic, brooding at times. Aryan brings to grover the sensibility that this character so desperately needs, as well as the humor that is a must. There's not enough words to praise Leah as Annabeth. Is as if I opened the book, shook it around and she dropped right out of the pages. She IS Annabeth, and anyone who dares say the opposite for whatever reason is either blind or crazy. I've always said that the The Hunger Games Series was the most faithful book to movie adaptation I had ever seen, but by the end of season 1 of Percy, I might change my mind.","10","20 December 2023"
"Review","I tried not to get my hopes up for this, thinking they were going to be dashed, but after seeing the first episodes I am incredibly surprised. This show is amazing. It's book accurate, but adapted so that it fits cleanly into a new medium. It has a great balance of humor, action, and emotional scenes, and any book fans will love this show from the first second onwards. The score works well to tie everything together, and the characters are impeccably casted. Every actor, small and big embodies their role and gives dimension to the character, bringing justice to the book. The last adaptation we got was terrible, but this one is the absolute opposite. Watch it.","10","21 December 2023"
"Yes!","Just. Yes!  Super happy with the adaptation and the actors are truly brilliant, I can't wait to see their careers in the future if they're this great already!  The first two episdose, tears of joy the entire way through. Though there were some aspects of the book that I really wished to hear (like the Donkey Legs moment;D - not a spoiler because the scene was in the trailer-) I'm really happy with all the amazing ways the story was adapted to be a series. You get to know everything you need to know, when you need to, and in brilliant ways! The pacing is fantastic, the CGI is brilliant and I honestly cannot wait to watch the next episodes, and hopefully the next seasons too🤞🤞🤞  Well done Mr Riordan! Well done!💙","8","21 December 2023"
"A really great show and a faithful adaptation!","As a long-time fan of the books, I've been super excited about the release of this show for a very long time, and I'm glad to say it did not disappoint. Everything from the technical, practical side of things (CGI looks great, directing is really good, lighting, sets, and colour grading all look beautiful) to the casting and acting and overall feel of the show is just perfect. They captured the humour of the characters but also their depths and their emotions. Especially after seeing the third episode, Leah is the best Annabeth, Walker is the best Percy, and Aryan brings a fresh outlook to Grover that I am obsessed with. On top of all that, they have great chemistry as the main trio. I can't wait to see the rest of the first season!! They are killing it so far.","10","28 December 2023"
"The fandom is the issue","This is an amazing show. The actors truly embody the characters. Even the stuff they had to change (because let's remember here: they HAD to change things. It is IMPOSSIBLE to create a perfect movie/show based on a book. And even if you could people would complain about the pacing) stays in character. At certain points me and my sister were talking about how some of the changes were somehow MORE in character which is the important part about including the author in the adaptation.  The only real issue with this show is that the fandom is too hard to impress. They don't want to look at anything positive. If it's not an exact match to what they personally imagined it's awful. They hate that Percy is blond. They hate that Annabeth is brunette. They hate that Annabeth is black. The pacing is too slow. The pacing is too fast. Percy is too bland. Percy is too snarky. Hell I saw someone genuinely upset because Nancy threw cheese at Grover rather than a peanut butter sandwich. (This is all in the trailer so I'm not counting it as a spoiler)  TLDR: If I could stay in a vacuum away from the fandom this would be a perfect show.","10","28 December 2023"
"What we needed","I am a huge fan of the books. I've watch the movies as a kid wishing they could be anything like the books I've read and loved so much. Now finally, after years of waiting, me and all the fans who loved the books have an adaptation worthy of the books. It's exactly like I've imagined the scene with small bonus scene I didn't know I needed. Thank you so much for that. Walker as Percy is simply magnificent. He has the same energy, the same sarcasm and even his expression are how imagined him. He simply is Percy Jackson.  We can't talk about this show without talking about freaking Sally Jackson! WOW! The casting was perfect and how she acts is juste simply magnificent. She is the powerful yet calm and funny mother that we all needed. Everyone's casting is simply perfect. A really big special mention to Aryan who plays Grover, who plays Grover the best way possible. He feels directly out of the book for me and it couldn't make me happier.  If you loved the books, please watch this show. It's slowly healing my inner child...","8","22 December 2023"
"Loved it","First if all I am a devoted pjo fan and I have been looking forward for it far a long time and now that it came out I will write my honest opiniop I think it was really good because it was fairly like the book and the things that weren't make sense very much like the fact that Percy only got his pen in the start but I liked also that Ms dodss attack was in the open because it showed the power of the mist and real liked it and also I loved the second episode more because it was intreducing a loy of new and old beloved characters and it was very satisfying to see, it was also much more action. Thank you for reading.","10","24 December 2023"
"The best thing since the books","One of the best adaptations I've seen in awhile. The way you can feel Uncle Rick's presence in the show is awesome. As well as the passion the actors and actresses put in to make the show all the more fascinating and true to the original plot was astonishing.  The storyline was followed beautifully and the foreshadowing with Easter eggs is definitely something to watch out for.  I cannot wait for the next episodes to see what they do with the overall plot and how they manage to do some of the stunts that seemed impossible on paper let alone in real life.  If you enjoy Greek mythology or just a good tv show to watch with family or friends this is definitely a show that you can get hooked on!","10","22 December 2023"
"Sadly Underwhelming and Unfaithful","Several changes to the character's personalities and story unfortunately make what could have been a faithful adaptation of the books, another poor attempt. Pacing is off and dialogue for the characters somehow manage to be uninteresting despite its source material. It seems as though Rick Riordan is using this as a chance to change things he didn't like in the books instead of remaining true to the books. Acting is cringeworthy with a few exceptions and the lack of budget is apparent in almost every scene (i.e. Medusa's head).  Take the away the source material and the loyal fan base and it's just a meh show that will shock me if it makes it 5 seasons.","2","29 December 2023"
"AMAZING & FAITHFUL TO THE BOOKS!","I've always loved the books, I've read them many many times first starting when I was in the seventh grade. I remember watching the Percy Jackson movie for the first time in school, and being so disappointed- because it was so unrelated to the book. This series, however, is the exact opposite. Obviously not everything that is in the books can be included, but the writers are doing a great job of keeping the story as accurate as possible, and even making it flow even better than it did in the books!! The actors, specifically the main ones, are so phenomenal at what they do!! Their chemistry is top tier, and we're only three episodes in! You can tell these young actors really took time and put hard work into this project. The filmography is beautifully done, AND THE SOUNDTRACK? PERFECT. Specifically the track 'Camp Half-Blood'! It perfectly captures the wonder and magic of the gods and mythology, while also including the mystery and danger that also lies within. I can't wait to see the final results when all of the episodes are out, and I'm praying we get more seasons, because young kids deserve to see themselves represented in such a well done series!","10","29 December 2023"
"Love it!","I read the books when I was a kid and when those movies came out I was so disappointed. They did the books so dirty. But this show, is so so good it's already following the book more than the movies did. And even tho some of the characters don't look exactly the same as books I'm honestly okay with that because they got the personalities spot on. And I'm okay with them adding some different scenes as well. It's so far really good and I'm enjoying it a lot. I can't wait for more episodes to come out. I'm so glad they decided to make this because I've always wanted these books to come to life and they finally did it right.","10","20 December 2023"
"So amazing","This is one of the best book to screen adaptions i have ever seen. It is up there with the hunger games. You can tell that the author of the books was very much involved in the entire process of making this show, from the amazing casting, to the script that genuinely mirrors the books, and the amazing overall production of the show including the soundtrack. Walker scobell is the best kid to play percy jackson, he so seamlessly makes the character his own while still staying true to the books. As someone who read the books and was severely disappointed in the movies i take joy in the fact that i can watch this and be fulfilled. Thank you rick for righting this wrong.","10","29 December 2023"
"BEST ADAPTATION EVER","I've been reading and rereading these books for over a decade and I've always thought an adaptation would never be able to match up to the perfect story I had created in my head (especially after the burning trainwreck that was the movies) but THIS DID IT. I won't spoil anything but all of the main actors COMPLETELY embody their characters and they all add little things that add up to make the characterization that much more in-depth. Every change they've made has completely suited the story and it's just been absolutely perfect. If this is the only review you see, I urge you: GO WATCH IT!!!!!","10","29 December 2023"
"On Par With the Movies...Which Isn't Good","I've read the books five times since middle school and was genuinely excited to get a TV adaptation during my third year of college. However, this adaptation is not it!  From the start, we are expositioned to the extreme! Many characters, Luke especially, have no purpose but to explain every little thing to the audience and the pacing is incredibly rushed. Instead of the director and producers taking advantage of the extra time a TV show has to allow the audience to digest and process what they see, they have every weird thing explained away as soon as it happens and the viewer does not need to think at all. Even if he wanted to, he has no time as the show moves on to the next scene and something else happens and is promptly explained away, and on and on we go.  The acting is also incredibly wooden. Only Dior Goodjohn and Aryan Simhardi seem to be trying - not most successfully - but at least I see a semblance of Book-Clarisse and Book-Grover in them. Both Walker Scobell and Leah Jeffries' deliveries are unconvincing and lack charm, looking like they're reading out of the script and given no freedom or room to show their acting capabilities and ranges. Glynn Turman and Jason Mantzoukas are okay, but Jason's Dionysus could also use some of the flare, eccentricity, and nonchalance his book counterpart is known for.  Most of the changes from book to screen do not make much sense either. The characters' physical appearance is only the outer layer but they do make me wonder if this show even has a hair and makeup department; surely wigs or hair dyes or hair extensions could have brought the actors closer to their book counterparts like they have for most book-adapted TV shows and movies, like Harry Potter or House of the Dragon. Even a little thing like Luke's scar is barely noticeable, and in the wrong spot at that, and Clarisse, who is supposed to be big and tough and uncaring about her appearance, and Annabeth, who does not care much about hairstyles in the books, both come off like preppy dolls, caring more about their looks than their comfortableness during training or Capture the Flag.  The characters' personalities are as transformed as their appearances and some do not make much sense. Sally, acting submissive to protect Percy in the first book, is a spitfire and resembles Book-Percy more than Walker's Percy does. Gabe's awfulness and despicable character are also absent for some reason and he looks like a regular middle-aged loser rather than the drunk abuser that marked Percy's childhood in the books. Percy also comes off as whiny, only caring about impressing his dad - a far cry from the charismatic and relatable character most of us love from the books. Walker's Percy does have his moments, I'll give him that, but most of his jokes fall flat and his charm, as mentioned, is not there. Some of his digs at Annabeth in Episode 3 are also uncalled for and come out of nowhere, but so does Annabeth's attitude towards Percy. The two are antagonistic towards each other for no reason - though Percy being confused about stuff and Annabeth not explaining things to him does come directly from the books.  While I do think that a perfect copy-paste book-to-screen adaptation would be boring, I am at a loss to understand why so many changes were necessary. From the first minutes of the first episode, some key moments have been omitted for seemingly no reason. The fight with Ms. Dodds - except for the fact that it happens in full view of passers-by in New York instead of inside the museum - ended in two seconds and is unworthy of even being called a fight. Same for the ""fight"" with the Furies in the bus in Episode 3 - sorry: one Fury and it barely lasted two seconds before they high-tailed it out of there. The skirmish with the Minotaur was a bit better but it still went very fast; if those are the fight scenes we are to expect from this adaptation, prepare yourselves to be sorely disappointed! Clarisse accusing Percy of ""being a fraud"" also doesn't make sense, and neither do Dionysus and Chiron concealing the fact that Percy's mother is in the Underworld and not dead instead of telling him to motivate him to accept the quest. The Fates have yet to appear as well, Riptide (yet to be named in the show surprisingly, I thought the sword's name would have come up somewhere in the middle of all the exposition) seems to shake whenever it anticipates danger like it suddenly acquired a conscience and the meeting with Medusa is completely underwhelming.  The CGI is a bit touch-and-go as well, mostly okay, and the soundtrack could use some improvement, as could the scene changes and the weird camera positions.  All and all, I'm very disappointed that after all the hype this is what we got. I will watch the season till the end to see if things improve, but if the first three episodes are any indication, then this has been an absolute failure of an adaptation!","1","28 December 2023"
"Cautiously Optimistic","Let me start by saying the show is still significantly better than the movies. The CGI is phenomenal for a television show and the way they brought Camp Half-Blood and the Minotaur to life was just awesome. They have somewhat followed the book which is also fairly nice.  That being said, the way they portrayed the Poseidon Cabin is just sad. There also is no suspense in any of the action scenes. Mrs. Dodds is here and gone so quickly that one can't even get invested. The capture the flag scene is also rapidly done that I don't feel any awe when the audience finally sees who Percy's parentage is.  What's worse is the changes they made to the story that make no sense whatsoever. Like Percy somehow whipping out intense combat moves against Clarisse before even being exposed to water and the fact that Gabe is not even that atrocious of a guy, just a bum.  The acting is medium at best, with some characters being well portrayed, like Mr. D, Grover, Chiron, and Luke; while other characters are one dimensional and boring, like Percy and Annabeth. The latter of whom has zero personality whatsoever.  I'm cautiously optimistic heading into the rest of the season that the pacing will even out and we'll start to get better writing with the suspense and more of the book personality from the two leads. Otherwise, I'll have to chalk up another adaptation of this awesome book series as a failure. The fact Disney is the one behind it does not give me much hope.","6","24 December 2023"
"Usual Disney Content v Quality","I like young mr Scobell, he has done well pitched in with movie megastars,playing almost like an understudy, with more cutting wit than others of his age group, but this rendition of Percy, although Rick Riordan author and writer of the script which is bland with nothing new to give from past versions,as it is episodic it drags ,no amount of special effects will save it from from obscurity.  This recipe is probably bread without the fillings and not a culinary delight,I think Disney with its present management should be barred from acquiring any further classics for reboots, the next generation should revolt by ignoring the product.","5","31 December 2023"
"Missed the mark...again.","Let me start off by saying the CGI and set are well done and I appreciate the diversity and acting of the cast - which makes the poor execution of the storyline and the dullness of the script all the more disappointing.  For some reason, the source material has been paired down to a fault in an effort to make the show suitable for audiences much younger than the YA books are intended for. Kids as young as 6 and 7 can't / shouldn't read the books, but they could definitely watch the show without issue. Every remotely ""gritty"" comment, theme, or scene from the books has been entirely erased, and it had detrimental effects on the storyline and characters.  Take Percy for example: by glossing over his internal struggles and making Gabe comedic relief rather than an antagonist, Percy's character is rendered completely devoid of personality. Where is his attitude, wit, and defiance? That was everything that made his character relatable to the YA audience! In the books, Riordan's monster-fighting scenes always put readers on the edge of their seats - in the show, these scenes are exceptionally lacking.  I feel bad for the kid actors because they're doing great with what they're given; it's the material that's inadequate. Overall, I can't continue watching. It's just as disappointing as the 2010 movie. Come on Riordan, get it right!","1","29 December 2023"
"I couldn't be happier","After so many attempts at a live action book adaptation let me down, i'm finally seeing one that exceeds every expectation. I didn't expect the show to be this good, but its starting out brilliantly! Watching the first episode immediately brought me back in time to when I first started reading the series as a kid. I feel like this will be the show that sets a new standard for live action remakes moving forward. This feels like reading a story with brilliant lighting and a well crafted playlist. Don't even get me started on the cast and how they somehow managed to recruit the most believable and talented young actors around. I genuinely couldn't be happier with this show and I had to leave a whole review just to let everyone know that lol.","10","20 December 2023"
"The Olympians' Most Disappointing Odyssey","This series, like most recent Disney reboots, is unsurprisingly disappointing. There are multiple things which I dislike about it:  1. The script feels unrealistic and artificial: unlike the books, and even the movies, you feel constantly disconnected from the plot. Every single conversation feels forced and inorganic. It's like they threw the script together in a rush, resulting in cringeworthy dialogue and performances that made it impossible to become immersed in the storyline.  2. Percy is neither charming nor funny. He is snarky, rude, unlikeable, and his personality is extremely different from the books. The same applies to Annabeth: they are both immensely more uncharismatic than in the books or movies. The actors and scriptwriters alike have managed to produce bland, unappealing versions of the characters, which makes them impossible to relate to or root for. Overall, both the acting and the casting are TERRIBLE (with the possible exception of Grover, but his lines don't do him any favors).  3. The series somehow manages to be too slow -in terms of the events occurring at any given time- and too rushed- whenever major things happen, everyone seems to get over them within seconds. Overall, every episode feels rushed, and yet, at the end of each of them, it feels like nothing substantial happened.  4. The action scenes, characterization of certain archetypes, and dialogue all feel childish. I understand that Percy Jackson is a children's book, but the series somehow dumbs it down even further to the point of absurdity.  5. The CGI and directing are pretty bad. The directing/editing is especially amateur-ish: how can a multi-billion dollar company allow for so many scene transitions to rely on fading black screens? Also, camera angle choices are often weird and overall bad calls... As for the CGI, its quality varies between 'decent' and 'horrible', depending on the scene.  What I liked about the series: 1. The soundtrack is pretty decent (with some exceptions). I don't like that they included more recent (TikTok) songs, such as Olivia Rodrigo's singles, since it feels inauthentic and disconnected to the books. Again, I think this was a conscious choice from Disney to appeal to younger generations, but, in doing so, it manages to alienate most of Percy Jackson's original fans.  2. I grew up reading the PJ saga, which was extremely influential to me as a child. Seeing it materialize to TV (irrespective of how mediocre the end product) is refreshing. I always felt like PJ was treated as being second to Harry Potter, and it's good to see more (deserved) attention being brought to it. Furthermore, it was nice to find out that Rick Riordan actually participated in the making of the series.  Conclusion: If you are under 15, or a Disney adult, you're in for a treat. If you're an original fan of the books or movies, I advise you to give it a chance, but under the understanding that you'll most likely dislike it, as I myself did.","2","30 December 2023"
"Trying something different, but overall pointless","I understand needing to make changes in an adaptation, it's an adaptation. But if you make changes they have to be changes that make sense. Try to portray Medusa as a victim of the gods? Sure! But then we have to turn around and kill her anyways, so it was pointless. For some reason no one believes Percy killed the minotaur. Okay, sure I guess that can be a nice little side plotline... OR we can introduce this plotline and take it absolutely nowhere. Or we keep making references to Thalia, which let's be clear, it's pronounced Talia, and not THalia. But we have already randomly brought up Thalia almost 500 times, when she has nothing to do with the first book. It's just a whole lot of them explaining things, and explaining things, and not just showing us things. We randomly introduce conflict between the characters where there was basically no need for it just to pad the runtime. Let's have the Fury try to make a deal with Annabeth. Did it matter? No. Did we do it anyways? You bet. We just keep making spontaneous changes that don't seem to matter at all, so if they're changes that don't matter, and don't add anything to the story, why are we still doing it? Like Percy getting claimed was essentially reduced to a joke in comparison to how it was revealed in the books. Or Percy deciding to hide part of the prophecy from his two friends, and then immediately telling them anyways, 20 minutes later. Or Grover, randomly deciding to sing a song. Was it important? No. Did it add anything besides a bit of cringe? You bet. At a certain point they're just doing things for the sake of doing it. Again, I understand trying to make your own changes to something for your adaptation. But just none of it makes sense. The entire Medusa episode basically just felt like 45 minutes of essentially nothing. Like I thought it was super necessary watching the main characters arguing over what snacks they want from the gas station. Or watching Annabeth debate what flavor of candy to buy at said gas station. All in all, it just feels like we are padding the runtime with things that just don't matter overall.","3","27 December 2023"
"IT'S AMAZING, OBSESSED","Amazing, exceeded all expectations and more. Love the casting, cgi, everything. Hoping for season 2🙏🏽 The first episode started off with some great visuals, hilarious jokes and so many well written characters. Even some foreshadowing. There was on fight scene which was amazingly done and the acting from the kids were really great.  Episode two started off with the iconic, ""you drool while you sleep"" line. And the jokes just got better. Dionysus was really well done and so book accurate. Luke seemed really nice and it seems like him and Percy will have a great friendship😉 Annabeths dialogue, and her fixing his armor was so adorable. The capture the flag scene was so good. The fighting didn't look comically fake at all, very believable and the actors are so talented. CLARISSE'S SCREAM!!! AMAZING.  The third episode was filled with Percabeth banter and arguing. Some backstory and the story was a bit different than the books but still made sense and was well executed. Once gain, THE KID ACTORS. Sooo gooddd. They had an emotional scene and it wasn't cringe or fake at all. Literally obsessed with the show.  If you aren't sold on the casting, I recommend you watching the watch party of them on YouTube. Their chemistry is so fun and adorable. Begging for all five seasons!!!","10","27 December 2023"
"So far so good upto episode 3","So far the TV show is quite enjoyable im only upto episode 3 but am enjoying it. It has missed a few semi important plot points that are relevant later in the story line or make the initial story more interesting if they the series going that far. Like the snipping of the yarn at the bus stop and just how bad Gabe (Percy's Stepfather) really is both in smell and as a person, but so far the storyline is holding up well to the books much better than the films did anyway. The characters dont match how they are portrayed in the books but they have chosen their actors well even if they're not what you originally expect.","7","27 December 2023"
"iconic stunning legendary","I couldn't have hoped for a better first two episodes !! I kept gasping as i watched as if i didn't already know the story. The casting is perfect, the little details from the book like mr D's diet coke are so fun, literally everything is so good. The few aspects that are different from the book don't take away from the story at all and even make it better. The characterization, emotion, and vibes are immaculate. Idk man i need more characters for this review to be long enough but im sleepy rn and i can't think of more ways to say this show is so good. Counting down the days till the rest of the season comes out ! (please let all 5 books be adapted PLEASE I BEG)","10","24 December 2023"
"This show makes me so happy","I will never stop talking about this show, I swear. The casting is incredible and the actors do an amazing job of implementing little things that become important later on (fatal flaws, percabeth, etc). The plot stays very true to the books, but also adds on to the storyline by making it more current and able to be watched by kids today. There are clever methods used to depict mature-ish themes, so that you can understand what's happening, but to make it understandable for younger viewers. Overall, the show is a very faithful adaptation, and will be beloved by so many fans for many years to come.","10","29 December 2023"
"First three episodes watched","I'm enjoying it so far as only watched the first three episodes. Looking forward to the rest of them :) Big fan of the books and if Uncle Rick approves then so do I.  The only thing I'm annoyed at is the night bits are really dark and can't see anything going on. Also some of the changes they've made from the original material are interesting but don't change the actual story so not as bad as one would think.  Looking forward to watching the characters/ actors grow up during the next few episodes and hopefully the whole book series.  Crossing my fingers they will also do the other series in the world of Percy Jackson :)","9","28 December 2023"
"Captured the soul of the book. Much better than the movies","It is all I have been waiting for for a decade. The actors are phenomenal and really portrays all emotions well. All small changes made are for the better!  The movies butchered all portrayals of the characters and there were no emotion. The storyline was nothing like the book, but this is a much more faithful adaptations that has the potential of forming a whole generation.  It also does a great job at showing that even if you are different you are worth the same as others and that those differences can be your strength. Camp Half-Blood is a place were all people who feel like an outsider belongs.","10","28 December 2023"
"Perfetum","They did the scene. Where he send medusas head to olympus which is one of my favourite thing he did in the book. I like annabeth so far and percy and i think both of them are talented actors. I just hope they have the same chemistry as they have in the book. The dynamic the have so far has a lot of potential.  The whole series sets itself up for sucess in the future if they keep it going the same eay they go now and i think thing will get better and better the more time it goes because the relatolnships will get mor flushes out.  The cinematography is really really good and the cgi is amazing compared to for example mcu.","","27 December 2023"
"You gotta watch this","2 episodes in and this series is both exactly what I imagine and not at all what I imagined having been a huge fan of the books since I was in the target audience (6th grade) The casting and acting is phenomenal and I already would hurt anyone who gets close to my babies! The visuals and cinematography are beautiful and the script is concise and fun and believable. My only complaint would be the pacing which to me feels a little off, but that does allow me to notice something new every time I rewatch it! This can be a new fun watch for the whole family or something us die hard fans can binge and rave about! It adds new stuff that really enhances the story while at the same time being completely true to the books. I am 100% confident they will make it through the first 5 books/seasons and I CAN'T WAIT to see how it turns out!","10","21 December 2023"
"Finally Percy Jackson gets to see the big screen","For real though the 2 Percy Jackson movies are my least favorite movies of all time. Because of how badly they disrespected the source material.  But this show does it right, they got author of the book series Rick Riordan to be a part of making his series come to life on the big screen and I'm all here for it.  A lot of people are dunking on the show for their casting choices, but honestly Grover is the only character I wish was casted differently. He delivers his lines in an okay way but he's just not the Grover I pictured when reading the book  This show isn't perfect but every book to screen adaptation needs to cut a little content here and there so overall great time and also nice and family friendly weather or not you liked the books or the movies (I really hope you didn't) great show 8.8/10 I wish IMDb would let me give an 8.8 instead of just a 9 to be honest.","9","25 December 2023"
"Stop the whining!","I couldn't even get through the third episode. I was hoping once Percy got the quest he would stop all the whining and oh poor me mantra; it's exhausting and kind of infuriating to listen to; way worse than the movie (probably bcuz it's stretched out over so many episodes its like Percy stays in his pity pot). The writing is so poor for Percy and the young actor has no facial expressions throughout. Plus the issue Clarisse has with Percy was completely underdeveloped and seemed random unless you know the movie or books.... and a minotaur in chonies??? Was that supposed to be a joke, seemed wildly out of place.  For what we all pay Disney every year (tickets to movies, Disneyland, streaming app, clothing, kids toys and clothes etc!) and the following Percy Jackson has, we do expect better writing and acting. Sorry Disney 😞","1","29 December 2023"
"childhood dreams come true!","So fat, the show has been so close to the book it nearly brought me to tears. As a kid and as an adult i still absolutely adore the books, and theyre finally doing an accurate, well thought out and high quality adaptation. Tons of folks are complaining about the acting, but to me, theyre still kids- what do you expect? Theyre still getting into the groove! I think they're embodiment of the characters has been great so far, and true to each character. Walker showed us he could be snarky and sarcastic in the adam project, and he hasnt disappointed in his portrayal of percy ""persassy"" jackson. Annabeth is blunt, intelligent, and determined. Grover is nervous, but kind and true. Jason is killing mr. D's role, too.  Ive seen some complaints about the pacing as well, and although it is super fast paced, so is the book. Theres TONS of infodumping in the first 100 pages of the book, so it felt the same to me when translated to the screen; however i can understand those who never read the books when they feel it is too fast paced. To me, i think it worked well to mimic how lost, confused, and uncomfortable percy is supposed to feel! He knows just as much as the viewer does, which works well for world building. It puts you in his shoes. The cgi, makeup, sets, and camera work has been actually astonishing (which i didn't expect, although that might be silly because its the same folks behind marvel). As a die hard fan since 12 (21 now) I'm super excited to see the rest of the show! Ive been waiting for a faithful adaptation since i picked up the first book, and i havent been disappointed like with the movies.","10","24 December 2023"
"We are so back","I first read the books when I was 12 and that was nine years ago now. I have since reread the books countless times and they still are some of my favorite books. I despised the movies, not only because the change in plot or because they aged up the character but because it didn't capture the soul of the books. Percy was a kid struggling in school (even when he tried), not an angsty teen who couldn't care less.  People who complains that he is more mean and snarky forget two things: his mum is gone and he has always been like this. The only thing that has really changed is that he says those things out loud in the show (instead of it being inner monologue like in the books).  Annabeth is also a character that many complains about and I think they need to reread the books. Annabeth was calm and collected in the books. She was kinda short with words and a bit socially awkward (being neurodivergent and having grown up surrounded by kids older than yourself tends to do that). She is prideful (which is what we see in the episodes - her doing everything to win, her wanting to be the one in charge, her being ""rude"" to medusa. It's her pride, which is her fatal flaw). Annabeth in the movie was a damsel in distress and Annabeth in the show (or book) isn't.  There are changes in the story yes, but they are all very clever and I understand why they have been made. For example making Luke be the one to show Percy around the camp made them closer, which will make the ending of the season hurt more. But more important the show still manages to capture the soul of the books.","10","29 December 2023"
"Absolute garbage","If you're looking for a faithful screen adaptation of the Percy Jackson books, save yourself the trouble and don't watch this show. All of the casting decisions are awful. The writing feels even more childish than the books, which are designed to be enjoyed by 12-15 year olds. Percy and Annabeth are insufferable, and they even managed to make Sally Jackson unlikeable. If you've ever read the Maze Runner series, this ""adaptation"" (if you can even call it that) reminds me of what Hollywood did to the Scorch Trials. Vote with your wallet and quit financially supporting the garbage that Disney keeps pumping out. The Lightning Thief movie was nothing special but it's miles ahead of this series.","","30 December 2023"
"Disney's adaptation hits all the mark that makes it Percy Jackson","As a long time reader and fan of the books, this adaptation hits all the mark that makes it Percy Jackson. Seeing all the characters comes to life makes me happy and satisfied to know that this story will not only live on the pages but also now stay on our screens for the kids and all to watch and become a way for them to read the books and enjoy this timeless stories.  I love little details from that book brought to life on the series such as the mist, orange camp half blood shirt, blue food, the yankees cap and many more. Rick Riordan is my favorite author and this series makes me glad that I discovers Percy stories that inspires me in life to face my fears and be brave, to read more and to discover my love for adventure and being a hero for yourself and others.","10","23 December 2023"
"Loved it so far!!","I only watched the first three episodes, but I have to say: especially as a Big Fan of the Books, so far I'm really happy with everything! I love how the actors portray their characters and the way the story is so close to the Books. Of course it's Not the Same: and it's really Hard to portray Percys Character without his monologe that we read in the books. But I think they did a Great Job so far. The actor is a really good Percy in my opinion and I'm really excited for the next Episodes and all the new fans that discover the fandom now through the show. I really hope they won't cancel it and we will see the whole story!!!","10","29 December 2023"
"Loving it","As a lifelong superfan of the books what I've seen of the show so far is incredible. The casting is terrific and the chemistry of the main trio is off the charts. There are obviously going to be inconsistencies or changes from the book, but in my opinion that's just what happens when adapting the written word to a visual format. Any changes that have happened don't damage the core plot and still get the same message across. If you want a completely faithful version of the lightning thief read the books! This show is an adaptation and artistic liberties and changes are allowed to happen. I'm so excited for the rest of the season and hopefully it'll get renewed for season 2 soon!!","10","28 December 2023"
"great show with amazing writing","The characters like Annabeth, Percy and Grover have such amazing development already, with only three episodes in. The actors do a fantastic job of delving into the characters pysche and really feels like the characters are being ripped out of the books. IMO, the reviews giving it a low rating need to do an immediate reread of the books if they think the characters or the plot is in accurate in any way. Any changes made to the book for the show was done for better depth and smoother on screen interactions. I throughly enjoyed how they flesh out character dynamics and character flaws so early into the show and I'm excited to see what the rest of the show brings. I can't wait for a (hopefully) guaranteed season two of the show as well.","10","29 December 2023"
"Exciting","I've read the books and from the opening scene of the show it had felt like the books coming to life! The casting of Percy feels very spot on to Percy's personality in the books, even if he doesn't match the description, which is exciting thinking about what is still to come from our young hero! There are some liberties they have taken with the show that feel different but don't really change the plot which is bound to happen with an on screen adaptation of a book series. I am excited to see how these young actors portray these iconic characters from this beloved series. My biggest complaint is I wish the episodes were longer haha.","9","27 December 2023"
"Serious Promise if You've Read Them Recently","Although if you haven't read the books recently, the show also is very entertaining, well paced, and shot beautifully to the level of other high budget shows, such as HBO shows.  Any reviews saying Percy isn't as funny or the show is not faithful to the books already in the first two episodes, simply have a bias in their opinion from when they read the books long ago, and do not remember the intricacies and mental hardship of what Percy was going through at the beginning of the books. Percy is exactly as he was in the beginning of the books down to the sadness, anger, and humour, along with some added scenes to give more context to the entirety of his situation.  The other actors portray their characters beautifully with poise, grit, humour and an unbelievable amount of maturity from cast members ranging from 13-19. Annabeth is exactly as she needs to be right now, down to the wit, subtle confidence, and wisdom in her eyes. Grove is exactly as funny and anxious as he was portrayed in the books. Luke is brilliantly portrayed as what he needs to be for Percy.  I cannot stress enough how beautifully this show is shot, from the colour grading, to the movement during fights, to the special effects. Everything is on point for a show at this level. Not to mention everything about the camp is completely accurate.  Anyone who has already predetermined that they do not like this show because of ""the pacing"", or ""the effects"", or even ""the way the actors look"", from just the first two episodes - have simply shown how little they understand about not only the pacing of tv shows, visuals in film, and acting, but also the entirety of the books in general.  DO NOT MISS OUT ON THIS SHOW!","10","23 December 2023"
"Better than the movies","Faithful to the books as the author of the book series, Rick Riordan, as the creator and writer of this tv adaptation.  Like so many others who read the books as a young teen, the movies were so disappointing that lacked character development. And it's evident since the movies did not involve the original author, Rick Riordan, in the development of the movies.  I'm so glad this TV series is faithful. I'm looking forward to see where the series will go. Admittedly, the demographic for the original books at the time of the release have grown up, future generations would definitely love the books and the new tv series adaptation.","10","26 December 2023"
"Something good could come from this","It's a bit slow as others have said - however this is just like the beginning of the first book. I read the books after watching the film adaption, and was pained by how slow it was. However after finishing the books, the film felt very off. This series feels different. It's resemblance to the books is far stronger than the film, yet it still has its own personality. This series definitely has potential.  I think the episodes could be a little longer, with maybe a bit more happening in each.  I am very excited to see where the series goes, I like the little bits of comedy that have been thrown in, and the casting seems okay so far.","9","30 December 2023"
